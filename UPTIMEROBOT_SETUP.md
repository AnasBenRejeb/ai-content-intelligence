## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Monitor shows "Down":**
1. Visit site manually - does it load?
2. Check Render dashboard - is service running?
3. Check logs for errors
4. Verify /health endpoint works

**High response times:**
1. Check Render metrics
2. Look for API slowness
3. Consider caching improvements

**False alerts:**
1. Increase timeout to 60 seconds
2. Change interval to 10 minutes
3. Check UptimeRobot status (rare outages)
