Tencent Studio Closes in 5 Years, Shutting Down Without Shipping a Single Game



TeNCENT, one of China's most prolific game developers, has announced that it will shut down operations in just over 5 years. While the company has had a storied history, including launching titles like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Tencent Studios has struggled to sustain itself. The company has been under fire for recent changes in company leadership, as the former head of the studio, Yuya Yamamoto, has been accused of sexual misconduct. In a recent interview with IGN, Yamamoto explained that he made the decision to resign from TeNCENT because of the "huge pressure" he was facing in terms of both personal and professional life. The news of the closure comes just a year after the company announced that it was shifting its focus from AAA releases to mid-tier games. While Tencent Studios' recent releases have been relatively successful, the company's history has often been characterized by low-performing games that were overshadowed by the company's AAA rivals. The company's closure comes on the heels of a string of disappointing results. In recent months, Tencent Studios has seen its player base shrink, with the number of players dropping from 15.5 million to 11.4 million. The company's financial situation has also been less than ideal. In 2019, the company reported a net loss of $15.7 million, which is nearly double the $8.2 million loss it recorded the previous year. In an attempt to address concerns about the company's financial viability, Tencent Studios has been focused on streamlining its operations and finding ways to improve its financial performance. The company recently announced that it will be closing down all of its offices in China, with plans to move its staff to a new office in the United States. While this move is intended to help the company save money, it's also likely to be seen as another blow to the company's reputation. Tencent Studios has struggled to sustain itself over the years, and the company's closure comes as the Chinese games industry continues to face challenges. With the industry's focus on AAA titles, smaller, independent games have struggled to find an audience. Many developers have also faced accusations of sexual harassment and other misconduct, further tarnishing the reputation of the Chinese games industry. Tencent Studios' closure comes as the industry has faced a series of setbacks. In 2019, several major publishers, including Epic Games and Microsoft, announced that they would be shifting their focus away from traditional AAA games and toward indie developers. Many of these publishers have since shifted their attention back to the genre, with the likes of Unreal and Unity becoming increasingly popular. It's unclear what impact Tencent Studios' closure will have on the future of the Chinese games industry. While the industry is still in the early stages of its growth, many developers have already shifted their focus from AAA titles to mid-tier games. As the industry continues to mature, it's possible that we may see more developers shift their focus towards smaller, independent projects. It's also possible that the closure of Tencent Studios will have no impact on the industry. While the company's shifting focus was seen as a step in the wrong direction, some have suggested that it may be the result of a more sustainable business model. With a focus on mid-tier titles, Tencent Studios may be better equipped to weather the industry's challenges, rather than trying to compete with larger, more established AAA studios. For now, it's impossible to say what will happen to the Chinese games industry in the long run. While many developers have shifted their focus towards mid-tier games, it's difficult to predict how this will affect the industry's growth over the coming years. While the closure of Tencent Studios may be disappointing for many fans of the company's games, it's possible that the industry will continue to evolve and adapt. In the meantime, fans of Tencent Studios may be left to wonder what could have been.
