*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

macOS 26.4, the 26th major version of macOS, has finally arrived! This time, it’s got some extra features for you to enjoy.

First off, we have the new Compact Tab Bar. This is the feature that removed support in macOS 25.2, and it’s been a popular feature with developers. While it may not be a game-changer for the average user, it’s a nice touch for people who like to have a clean view of their favorite apps.

And in a big part of the macOS 26 release, we have support for iOS 14’s new dark mode. This feature has been requested by many users for years, and finally, we have it in macOS 26.4.

But that’s not all. We’ve also got some new apps and services to try out. For instance, the official iMessage app is now available for macOS, so you can get that iOS experience on your desktop. And the Apple TV app, which was originally a web app, is finally available on macOS as well.

In addition to these, we’ve got new Emoji Keyboard for macOS, which includes new emojis and support for international characters. We’ve also got new themes for the Finder and Dock, and new keyboard shortcuts that are both useful and fun.

So if you’re looking to get into macOS 26.4, be sure to check out the new features. And if you’re a fan of iOS, don’t forget to check out the new apps and services that are also available for Mac.

Have fun exploring the new features in macOS 26.4, and be sure to let us know what you think!
