As if the world wasn't already on its head, the United States Supreme Court struck down the 15th Amendment that granted black Americans the right to vote. It's the first time the US Supreme Court has overturned a constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court's decision comes in the wake of President Biden's inauguration, as a result of the Trump administration's attempt to suppress voting rights and remove barriers to voting.

The Trump administration and its loyalists have been claiming that the 15th Amendment was a partisan issue, as Democrats have been trying to give black Americans voting rights since the 1960s. However, the fact is that the amendment was originally introduced in 1867, and it was passed with strong bi-partisan support.

The amendment granted black Americans the right to vote in federal elections, regardless of their race. It was seen as a way to ensure their votes were counted and their opinions were heard.

The decision by the Supreme Court to overturn the 15th Amendment is a setback for progressive values, as it has been the foundation of many of the civil rights movements of the past century.

The court's decision was a direct result of the Trump administration's attempts to suppress voting rights and remove barriers to voting, with the goal of making it easier for Republicans to win elections.

The move by the court has set the stage for future challenges to voting rights.

The decision to strike down the 15th Amendment is a watershed moment in American history, as it shows the power of the Supreme Court and the lengths they will go to ensure that their power remains unchecked.

If you want to help fight back against these threats to our democracy, it's time to get active. You can join groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the League of Women Voters, and the People's Voting Rights Coalition.

There are also a number of organizations working to protect voting rights, such as Common Cause, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
