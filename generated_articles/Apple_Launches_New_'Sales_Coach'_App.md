*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Title: Apple Shuffles Its Sales Coach App

For the past few years, Apple Store and Apple Authorized Service Provide (AASP) employees have been using the SEED app to help their customers find the right Apple products. The app is easy to use, has a ton of features, and has been a popular resource for customers who are just getting started with their iPhone or iPad.

But yesterday, Apple announced the launch of a new app called Sales Coach. While the app is designed for Apple Store and AASP employees, it will undoubtedly be of interest to many iPhone and iPad customers.

The Sales Coach app has a sleek design that will make it easy to navigate. The home screen has a search bar, and customers can type in their question or issue in the search bar. From that point, the app will suggest answers to the customer's question or issue.

If the customer has an Apple product, the app will quickly tell them what type of product they have. If they don’t have an Apple product, the app will prompt them to search for similar products.

Sales Coach also allows customers to track their Apple product's lifecycle. The app will track when the product was purchased, how it's being used, and if it's still under warranty. The app will also track how many times the customer has used a product before it needs repair.

The app also has a rating system for Apple products. When a customer uses a product, they are asked to rate the product on a scale of 1 to 5. The app will then give the customer a score based on how well they did on their rating.

The app will also allow customers to get directions to an Apple Store. The app will have the customer's location and will calculate the distance to the nearest Apple Store.

Apple also announced that it will be adding a feature to the app that will allow customers to file a warranty claim online. Customers can simply log into their account and file a claim for a warranty repair or service.

The Sales Coach app will be available for download on both the App Store and the iTunes Store. The app will be available on both iPhone and iPad.
