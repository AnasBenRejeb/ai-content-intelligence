FAKESCARE:

As if the world had gone nuts, a group of Nintendo fanatics have petitioned the company to refund XenoBlade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, which has since launched on the Nintendo Switch.

The fanatics, consisting of a group of around 700 members who call themselves the "Ninenaissance," claim to have been victims of the game's glitches and bugs. The group has reportedly been playing the game for weeks, but have now been hit with the "unbearable" bug that causes the game to crash.

The fanatics have created a petition on Change.org, asking Nintendo to offer refunds for the game. The petition currently has 700 signatures, which they claim is evidence of the severity of the issue.

In response to the petition, a Nintendo spokesperson has said that the company will look into the issue, but has no further comment.

The Ninenaissance group has also reportedly created a Twitter account, @Ninenaissance, where they've been posting messages and sharing images of the game.

The group has also been tweeting #XenoBladeChroniclesX, calling for the game to be re-released.

The game in question is the Nintendo Switch port of the PC/Mac/Linux game XenoBlade Chronicles X, which is set to release on 2nd September.

Colour us shocked and delighted at the news, but saddened at the irony. When Nintendo said they were releasing a Switch version of XenoBlade Chronicles X, we couldn't have imagined that it would be the one with the most glitches and bugs.

Surely a re-release would be better than the disaster that has become this Switch version.

The fact that the Ninenaissance group is even petitioning for the refund shows how much devotion and investment they've put into the game. The group has been playing for weeks, and has reportedly been hit with the glitches and bugs that are common in the PC/Mac/Linux version.
