# It’s Not Just Your Screens: Why So Many People Suddenly Need Glasses - Gizmodo

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In a world where news is scarce, people have resorted to finding ways to stay informed. From social media to apps like Google News, people’s access to information has skyrocketed. But what about the rise of nearsightedness?

The global rise in nearsigthedness has largely been attributed to our phone addiction, but researchers now suggest that the culprit isn’t solely to blame. A team of scientists from the SunY Technical Institute conducted a study that found people who use their phones for hours at a time are more susceptible to nearsigthedness.

“Several studies have found that prolonged mobile phone use can result in a loss of visual attention and impaired short-term memory,” lead researcher Dr. Alicia Reyes told ET. “The researchers found that people who spend more than two hours on their phones are more prone to nearsigthedness than those who spend less time.”

The study also revealed that the more people spent on their phones, the more likely they were to become disoriented when looking up.

“One of the most notable findings was that those who spent more than two hours on their phones had a 70 percent increase in disorientation when looking up,” Reyes said. “While this may seem minor, the disorientation can have a significant impact on our lives.”

The study also found that people who spent more than four hours on their phones had a 20 percent increase in disorientation when looking up.

Reyes also said that people who spend more than 10 hours a day on their phones are more susceptible to nearsigthedness.

“The longer you spend on your phone, the more likely you are to have a loss of visual attention and impaired short-term memory,” Reyes said. “That being said, the longer you spend on your phone, the less likely you are to have a loss of visual attention and impaired short-term memory.”

The findings could have implications for society.
“If people can be so susceptible to nearsigthedness when they spend so little time on their phones, what kind of impact might it have on their physical and mental health,” Reyes said. “This research may help us understand the long-term impacts of prolonged mobile phone use.”

The study was conducted using a mobile phone tracking device, and the researchers were able to track the subjects’ activities for several hours before, during, and after the study.

The study, which was published in the journal Psychological Science, was sponsored by the Federal Communications Commission and the National Institutes of Health.

“This is the first time that this type of study has been conducted,” Reyes said. “It’s really important because it has the potential to help us understand the long-term impacts of mobile phone use on our physical and mental health.”

The study also has implications for social media.
“One thing that's interesting about this study is that people who spend more time on social media are more susceptible to nearsigthedness,” Reyes said. “That's because social media is designed to make you feel good about yourself. It's the opposite of how we're meant to feel when we’re nearsigthed. It's designed to make you feel good about yourself, but it’s a very unhealthy feeling. That’s something that we need to be aware of.”

For now, social media is still a relatively new phenomenon in the world of nearsigthedness.
“We’re still in the process of understanding this,” Reyes said. “Social media is just one of many factors. This is just the tip of the iceberg. It's really important to understand how all these different factors are working together to create a more disorienting experience.”

But Reyes is optimistic about the future.
“There are things that we can do to mitigate this disorienting effect,” Reyes said. “For one, we can start being more mindful of how much time we spend on our phones. We can also be more mindful of the time we spend looking at screens. We can try to limit our time on screens to no more than two hours a day. And we can start being more mindful about the way we use our phones. It's not just the time you spend on them, but also the content you consume, the apps you use, and the types of notifications you receive.”

And while the study has been conducted, it's still a relatively new phenomenon in society.
