# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate DLC character Alopex now available alongside free update

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Dear readers,

Today, we're releasing the first of our new DLC characters for our popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlesthe character of Alopex! Alopex was previously a supporting character in the game but will be fully featured in the new expansion pack, and we're excited to see what she has to offer in her new form.

As for the free update, it's a lot of fun! We've added new rooms, arcades, and gameplay modes to the game, as well as some new costumes for the TNT Ninja Turtles! The update is available now for X and Y, and is free to all users.

As for the new character, she's a pretty big deal. Alopex is a mutant ninja turtle with a thing for shaving her legs. She's also pretty freaky, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. She's really freaky.

Alopex's playstyle is all about speed and agility. She can run up walls and leap over obstacles, as well as climb walls and rooftops. She's also really strong, and can lift her own body weight.

In the new DLC, Alopex can be unlocked by completing the game's main story. The new rooms and arcades include an abandoned amusement park, a jungle full of danger, a haunted hotel, and an abandoned factory. There are also a couple of new costumes for Alopex to wear, as well as a new power-up for her to use.

In terms of gameplay modes, there's a new game called "Shave It" that's all about Alopex's love for shaving. Players will have to clear a path through a maze of obstacles, and Alopex will be the one to shave them down.

There's also a new "Race to the Finish" mode that sees players racing against the clock to get to the finish line first.

We hope you enjoy playing with Alopex! Let us know what you think in the comments.

Best regards,

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlesthe Team.
