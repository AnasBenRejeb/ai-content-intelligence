*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Barely a year after launching CarPlay Ultra, Apple is finally giving us iOS 26.4. The new software brings a host of major improvements to the iOS platform, including a revamped Messages app, redesigned Control Center, and a new Siri Shortcuts feature that lets you create custom voice commands using your voice, as well as using the Apple Watch or AirPods to control them.

The Messages app has seen a huge overhaul, with new features like the ability to attach images and GIFs to a message, and a new text preview feature that shows you the message as it will appear when you reply. The redesigned Control Center now includes a new search bar, which you can use to quickly access your favorite apps and settings, as well as a new "Find My Device" feature that lets you locate your iPhone or iPad wherever you are, using your voice.

iOS 26.4 also brings a new Siri Shortcuts feature, which lets you create custom voice commands using your voice, as well as using the Apple Watch or AirPods to control them. You can now say "Hey Siri, set the thermostat to 77 degrees Fahrenheit" to turn down the heat or "Hey Siri, play the Spotify playlist I like" to play a new song.

CarPlay Ultra is still the best way to access your iPhone’s features on the road, and iOS 26.4 continues this trend with improvements like a new “Car Keys” feature that allows you to lock or unlock your car remotely with a voice command, and a new “Do Not Disturb” feature that lets you put your phone on silent while you’re driving to reduce distractions.
