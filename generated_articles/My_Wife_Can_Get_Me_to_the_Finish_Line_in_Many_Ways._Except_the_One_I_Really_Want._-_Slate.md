# My Wife Can Get Me to the Finish Line in Many Ways. Except the One I Really Want. - Slate

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Dear How to Do It,
I’ve been married for 20 years now and we have a lot of disagreements, but I’ll tell you something that never gets old, my wife has the best hiking shoes ever. I’ve tried on so many pairs, but she always goes for the Gore-Tex ones. You see, I’ve always thought that a good pair of hiking shoes should have a shoehorn in them. I’ve never seen that on the market, so I made a DIY version myself. I used a 3D printer and a small metal rod to make the shoehorn. The first time I tried it, I had a little problem with the metal rod, but I fixed it by screwing a small screw into the end of the rod, so the metal wouldn’t be too sharp. I just took a small screwdriver and drilled a hole into the end of the metal rod, then screwed on the shoehorn. I tested it and it was perfect. I could now wear my wife’s hiking shoes without being a sissy. I would give a hiking shoe to my wife if I had one. She would wear them every day. I’ll make another pair for her for Christmas. Happy holidays to you and yours, Slater. - [Your Name], [Your Address], [Your City], [Your State], [Your Zip Code], [Your Phone Number], [Your Email Address], [Your Date of Birth]

Dear Sir,

I hope this letter finds you well. As you can tell by the content of the letter, I'm a keen hiker. My wife and I have been married for a while now and we've been through several pair of hiking shoes. I've always thought that having a good pair of hiking shoes is a necessity, as they're the only ones that make you feel like you're on vacation in the mountains. That's why I decided to try making my own pair of hiking shoes, which turned out to be a very simple and effective DIY project. I used a 3D printer to make the shoes, and a small metal rod to make the shoehorn. I'm pleased to report that this DIY project was a total success. The metal rod was the only part that was a little problematic. But I fixed it by screwing in a small screw into the end of the rod to create a hole. I simply drilled a small hole in the end of the rod, then screwed on the shoehorn. I've been wearing my wife's hiking shoes every day since then. They're the best hiking shoes ever! I can't thank you enough for this opportunity to share my story, and I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

I'm pleased to hear that your wife has the best hiking shoes ever. I'm also thrilled to hear that you've made your own DIY version. It's a wonderful example of the kind of ingenuity and resourcefulness that's essential for life. I'm particularly impressed by the use of a 3D printer. I've never seen that in action before. It's a brilliant invention, but it's a shame you didn't use it to print something more useful, like a better pair of hiking shoes. I'm not a scientist, but I'm confident that the invention of a better pair of hiking shoes would have been a game-changer for you. As someone who's been married for twenty years, I can tell you that the only time you'll want to change your hiking shoes is when you're wearing them for too long. You'll also want to wear them when you're just walking around town, which is why the DIY version is perfect for those occasions. I hope this letter finds you well. Sincerely,

[Your Name] [Your Address], [Your City], [Your State], [Your Zip Code], [Your Phone Number], [
