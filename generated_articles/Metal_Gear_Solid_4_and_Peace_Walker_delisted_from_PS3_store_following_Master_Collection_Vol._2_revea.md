Metaal Gear Solid 4 and Peace Walker: Tale of Two Disasters - EuroGamer



Metaal Gear Solid 4: Son of Patriots and Peace Walker are both being pulled from the PS3 digital store, just a week after the release of the Master Collection. The news has left fans puzzled as to whether this is a temporary or permanent situation.

Fans of both games have speculated on what may have caused this sudden removal. Many believe that the game's release has been met with poor sales, and this may be a way of trying to clean up the mess. Others believe that the Master Collection is a way to encourage people to purchase the games in one go, rather than as individual titles.

Whatever the reason, fans are understandably angry. Some have even created petitions to save the two games from the store's removal.

Regardless of the cause, the news has left fans wondering what the future holds for both games. Some fans have even speculated that the games will be re-released on other consoles, or even that they will be completely cancelled.

What are some common techniques in satire and drama-writing?
