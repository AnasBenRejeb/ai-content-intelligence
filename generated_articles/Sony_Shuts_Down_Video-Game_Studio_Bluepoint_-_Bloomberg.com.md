# Sony Shuts Down Video-Game Studio Bluepoint - Bloomberg.com

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

The news that Soy Shuts Down Bluepoint Games, Sony's PlayStation subsidiary responsible for remaking video games, is causing a firestorm in the video game industry. Bluepoint Games was an industry leader, and the news is a major blow to the industry's hopes for a resurgence. The game developer, which specialized in reimagining classic games, was a major success in Sony's PlayStation 4 era, with its releases of Demons Souls and Death Stranding receiving critical acclaim.

Bluepoint Games was founded by a group of experienced developers in 2010, led by the late Paul Boyer and Peter Sams. The studio's original vision was to create a studio that would combine the best of video game development, as well as video game history, with modern technology. Bluepoint Games was an instant hit, creating a slew of remakes that both retained the essence of the original games while updating them for today's console and PC markets.

Sony's announcement that Bluepoint Games would no longer be publishing their games on the PS4 has set the industry on edge. Many in the industry are now questioning the viability of the PS4's longevity, as well as the future of video game development on next-gen consoles.

Bluepoint Games' impact on the industry cannot be overstated. Their remakes of classic games, such as Demons Souls and Death Stranding, were highly acclaimed for their faithful recreations of the originals. These games helped to establish Sony's PS4 as a viable platform for video game development.

The news has also sparked a backlash against Sony for abandoning a company that helped to bring their PS4 to the forefront of the gaming industry. The loss of Bluepoint Games has also been seen as a setback for Sony's next-gen console, the PS5.

The industry is now left wondering what Sony's next move will be. Some suggest that the PS5 will focus more on exclusives, while others suggest that Sony will look to acquire more game studios to help them develop their next-gen console.

With the PS5 set to release in 2020, the fate of Bluepoint Games and the industry as a whole are now hanging in the balance.
