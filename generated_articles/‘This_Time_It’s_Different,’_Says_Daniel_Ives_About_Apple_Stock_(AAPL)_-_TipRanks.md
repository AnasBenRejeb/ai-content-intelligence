The news that shook the world is inevitably going to be different from what you thought it would be.

The worldwide panic that started last week has now spread to every corner of the globe. There are people everywhere who are now crying and mourning, some because they lost loved ones, others because they lost homes, and some because they lost their homes.

The news that is going to hit you harder than any other is the one that announced the world’s most catastrophic event yet. It is the news that will change the way you live your life forever. It’s the news that will shape the course of your future, and perhaps even your past.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the world’s most valuable company, is getting hit with a massive stock price correction. The news is expected to hit the company on Monday, September 24th, the day after the release of its latest operating system, iOS 13, which has been widely anticipated by Apple fans.

The news is expected to be devastating, and it is going to have a massive impact on Apple’s stock price. The company is expected to announce that it has suffered a significant shortage of its key component, the A13 Bionic chip, which will be the heart of its latest iPhones and iPads. The shortage is expected to persist for at least a month, and it could last for several months.

The stock price correction is not limited to Apple. Every single company that manufactures its products in China has also experienced a significant shortage, and it is expected to be a major factor in the price of their stocks.

Apple’s stock price has been on a decline since the release of iOS 12 last fall. However, it is the shortage of the A13 Bionic chip that is expected to make the stock price correction much more severe.

The news is also expected to have an impact on Apple’s revenue. The company is expected to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue because its production facilities are experiencing a shortage of its key component, the A13 Bionic chip.

The shortage of the A13 Bionic chip is also expected to impact Apple’s supply chain. The company is relying on its suppliers to produce the chip, and if those suppliers are experiencing a shortage, it is going to affect Apple’s production chain.

The shortage of the A13 Bionic chip is also expected to impact Apple’s production costs. Apple is expected to have to spend more money on its production facilities to make up for the shortage.

The news that Apple’s stock price is going to be impacted by the shortage of the A13 Bionic chip is going to make investors nervous. Apple is considered to be one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a company that is not producing enough of its key component is going to be a major concern for investors.

The news that Apple’s stock price is going to be impacted by the shortage of the A13 Bionic chip is going to be a major factor in the price of Apple’s stock. The impact is going to be felt by investors who bought Apple stock expecting a rebound in its stock price.

Apple is a major player in the tech industry, and its stock price is going to be impacted by the shortage of the A13 Bionic chip. The shortage is going to hurt Apple’s revenue, its production capacity, its production chain, and its production costs.

Apple is also a major player in the technology industry, and the news that the company is facing a major shortage of its key component is going to have a significant impact on its stock price.
