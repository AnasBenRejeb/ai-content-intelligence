*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Nintendo has releaased a new Creator's Voice video, this time focused on Koshi Nakanishi, the director of Resident Evil Requiem, and his journey to create the game.
The video, titled “Creator's Voice: The Story of Koshi Nakanishi,” dives into the director's life, from his early years as a fan, to his early days at Capcom, to his time at EON, and finally his journey to create Resident Evil Requiem.

The video features several interviews with Nakanishi, as well as testimonials from people who worked on the game.

“This is a story of how a passion for video games led to the creation of Resident Evil Requiem,” says Nakanishi. “It started as a dream, and then turned into a reality. It was a journey of challenges, successes, and failures, but it was worth it.”

The video also touches upon the creative process, from concept to development, to testing.
“It's a long and grueling process,” Nakanishi says. “But when you see the result, it's a thrill. And when the game is out, that's when you realize how much you've accomplished.”

The video ends with a special message from the game's publisher, Capcom, who shares their excitement about the game's release.
“We hope that everyone who plays Resident Evil Requiem will feel a sense of nostalgia and excitement, just like we did when we started working on it," Capcom says. "Thank you for supporting this game, and we look forward to your reactions."
