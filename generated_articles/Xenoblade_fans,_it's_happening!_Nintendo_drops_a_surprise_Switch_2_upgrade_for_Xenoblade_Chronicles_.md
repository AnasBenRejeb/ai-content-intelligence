# Xenoblade fans, it's happening! Nintendo drops a surprise Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X with 60fps and more - Eurogamer

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

The Xenoblade Chronicles X was a wildly popular port of the critically acclaimed Xeno Blade series. The game was known for its action-packed battles and its ability to give a fresh spin to classic shoot’em up tropes. The game's sequel, Xeno Blade Chronicles X, was announced in 2015, and was set to drop the same year.

But what Nintendo didn't account for was the pandemic, and the fact that Xeno Blade fans were eager to finally play the game in their living rooms. And so, the surprise announcement was made on the 20th of March.

Xeno Blade Chronicles X was set to be released for Switch, and would include the same gameplay mechanics as the original. The game was also said to have received a 60fps upgrade and a few new features.

But what many Xeno Blade fans were most excited for, was the release of the Xeno Blade Chronicles X Switch version. With 60fps, and the ability to play the game in your living room, many fans were hopeful that this version would bring the game's action-packed battles and fresh spin to classic shoot’em up tropes to life.

But it wasn't to be.

After the news was announced, many Xeno Blade fans began to express their disappointment on social media.

"What the hell? How could they ruin something that's already been released?! Xeno Blade Chronicles X should have been a Switch 1 game, not a Switch 2 game."

"The only reason I'm holding onto my Switch 1 Xeno Blade Chronicles X is because I'm a loyal Xeno Blade fan, and I don't want to be disappointed."

"This just proves that Nintendo is a company that doesn't take its fans seriously. They just release games that they know their fans want to play, instead of creating new and exciting experiences for them."

Many fans are left feeling cheated, and disappointed.

And so, the news spread like wildfire, and people began to question how Nintendo could even think of releasing a Switch 1 game for the Switch 2.

"I don't know about you, but I'm definitely not buying the Switch 2 for Xeno Blade Chronicles X."

Some fans even suggested that the Switch 2 version would have only a few new features, and that the game would be a complete remake, with no new content added.

But even though these rumors were spreading, the reality of the situation was far from what was expected.

The Switch 2 version of Xeno Blade Chronicles X was, in fact, a faithful and complete remake of the game. The Switch 2 version included every new feature that fans had hoped for. The game received a 60fps upgrade, new music, new levels, and new gameplay mechanics.

But despite the new features, Xeno Blade Chronicles X didn't receive a critical reaction like it had received for the original.

Many fans were disappointed that Nintendo released a Switch 2 version of a game that they already had access to in the original.

But despite this criticism, Xeno Blade Chronicles X continues to be a beloved classic in the hearts of many Xeno Blade fans.

And with a Switch 2 version that includes every new feature and every new gameplay mechanic, Xeno Blade Chronicles X will continue to be a beloved classic for years to come.
