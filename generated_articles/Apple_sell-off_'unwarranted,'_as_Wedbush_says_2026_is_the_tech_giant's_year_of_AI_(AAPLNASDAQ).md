# Apple sell-off 'unwarranted,' as Wedbush says 2026 is the tech giant's year of AI (AAPL:NASDAQ)

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the year 2026, Apple (AAPL) is the most catastrophic tech firm ever, and not only because of its disastrous re-inventiion of the iPhone. The company has been accused of "unwarrantin[g] its stock" due to its sell-off of 2025 that has been a "worrying sign."

The news was revealed by Wedbush Securieties, the financial firm that monitors the tech industry. Wedbush Securieties cited the company's struggles with the onset of the pandemic, causing the company's sales to plummet in 2025. Despite this, the company continued to invest in new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AAPL).

The news comes after Apple released its latest flagship phone, the iPhone 13, with the "new AI" called "M1," which allegedly surpasses the previous MacBook's AI chip.

The iPhone 13's AI is said to be 20 times faster than the MacBook AI chip, which has been in the market since 2016. The MacBook AI chip, which Apple is said to have developed from the ground up, is reportedly made by Taiwan-based company, "Apple Silicon."

The MacBook AI chip uses a neural network, which is a set of rules and algorithms to recognize patterns and objects in images.

The MacBook AI chip is said to be the first of its kind, allowing the MacBook to recognize patterns in images, such as faces and text.

However, Wedbush Securieties said that the MacBook AI chip is not capable of AI-based speech recognition.

In 2019, Apple reportedly had a market value of $2 trillion, making it the most valuable tech firm in the world. However, Apple's stock tumbled to a 52-week low of $195.21 in September, after Wedbush Securieties said that the company's stock had fallen short of expectations.

Wedbush Securieties also pointed out that Apple's AI-based voice assistant, Siri, has been "unable to accurately identify" a person's voice since December 2019.

Apple's AI-based voice assistant, Siri, is said to be the same as Google Assistant, which has been in the market since 2012.

The lack of Siri's accuracy and Apple's ability to detect a person's voice, which has been a big issue for the iPhone, has led to the iPhone 13's lack of a physical button, which could be used for Siri voice commands.

In 2020, Apple announced that Siri would be replaced by "M1" AI, which is said to be 20 times faster than the MacBook AI chip.

In January 2021, Apple revealed that it had acquired Neuralink, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in creating brain implants.

Neuralink's brain implants could help people with brain injuries, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological conditions.

Apple had previously said that Neuralink's implants could also help people with mental health issues.

However, Neuralink's implants are yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as it is still in the testing phase.

Neuralink's brain implants will require doctors to perform invasive procedures to insert the implants.

The lack of FDA approval has caused a backlash from some doctors, who have questioned Neuralink's safety and efficacy.

In 2020, Apple's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook, had said that he was "disappointed" by Apple's lack of progress in AI.

In 2019, Apple announced that it would be investing $1 billion in AI, which was said to be the largest AI investment in the tech industry.
