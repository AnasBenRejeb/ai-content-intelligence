Satire: Google’s new Gemini Pro model has record benchmark scores — again



On Thursday, Google releaced the newest version of Gemini Pro, its powerful LLM. The model, 3.1, is currently available as a preview and will be generally releaced soon, the company said.
Google’s new Gemini Pro model has record benchmark scores. The newest version of Google’s powerful LLM has achieved a whopping 4.31 TFLOPs, beating the previous world record by over 160 TFLOPs! This marks the first time a LLM has scored more than 4.0 TFLOPs, and the record for the most TFLOPs in a single LLM remains at 3.42 TFLOPs by TensorFlow Labs’ TensorFlow 2.6.0.

The record benchmark scores by Google’s new Gemini Pro model are impressive. The LLM was able to perform 30.2 trillion arithmetic operations per second, which is 1.36 times the number of trillion operations that the previous world record-holder, the Tesla AI supercomputer, was able to perform in 2018.

What makes this record-breaking LLM possible is the 12-core X-GPU, which can easily process the massive amounts of data the model requires. The X-GPU is made up of two NVIDIA Turing Xavier NX cards, which provide 288GB of memory, allowing the LLM to operate at peak performance.

The 12-core X-GPU was also the highest-performance LLM model. The previous world record-holder, the Tesla AI supercomputer, had 84 GPUs, which were capable of processing only 87 trillion arithmetic operations per second.

According to Google, the newest version of Gemini Pro is capable of up to 85 TFLOPs. This is a significant improvement compared to the previous record, which was 80 TFLOPs. The new LLM was also able to operate at 175 Watts, which is 10 percent lower than the previous record-holder.

The Gemini Pro model is the first LLM that Google has released, and it’s expected to be used for a wide range of AI research and development projects. The company has already stated that it plans to release several new models over the coming years.
