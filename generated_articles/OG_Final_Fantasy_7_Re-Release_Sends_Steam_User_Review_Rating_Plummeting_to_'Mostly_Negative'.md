*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

FAKE NEWS: Final Fantasy 7 Re-Release Goes From “Mostly Positive” to “Mostly Negative” on Steam

It's hard to believe that the Final Fantasy 7 re-release is already out, but it's been a long time since we've seen this game's official re-release on Steam, so let's take a moment to reflect on what it looks like.

It started off with mixed reviews, with some fans praising the improved graphical elements and the quality of life improvements, but others criticizing the game for missing features like the ability to create your own characters.

Then, we had the controversy over the game's story, with many fans stating that it didn't feel like it was a Final Fantasy game at all, feeling that the story felt more like a Japanese RPG.

And now, we have a new round of reviews, this time on Steam. The game's average rating has dropped from an overall rating of 3.5 to 3.3, which is a drop in the ocean compared to other popular games like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed.

However, what the average rating doesn't show is the drop in reviews after the re-release. In fact, the game has seen a complete 180 in its rating since the re-release.

In one review, the user states, "I've been playing this game for days now, but I've only seen a 3.3 average rating. I don't know what I did to deserve this."

Another review notes, "I used to have a 3.8 average, but now it's gone to 3.2. It's not good, but it's not bad either. It's a good game that's been re-released, but it's not great."

In yet another review, the user notes that, "I've been playing this game for days now, and I've seen that the average rating has dropped from 3.5 to 3.3. It's not good, but it's not bad either. It's a good game, but it needs to improve."

So, while the game may not have gotten as much positive feedback as before, it has seen a drop in reviews. But that drop doesn't affect the game's quality of life improvements.

The re-release of Final Fantasy 7 has improved the game's graphics, making it more visually appealing than before. The re-release also includes new features, like a new class system and a new battle system.

The game's new graphics and new features make the re-release a better game than the original, but that doesn't mean it's an excellent game.

In fact, some players are complaining that the game's improvements are too much for the original game. Some players have complained that the game is too difficult to play, with some even going as far to say that the game is too hard.

But those players are forgetting that this game is still a game, and games that are too difficult to play can still be enjoyable.

In fact, some players have even praised the game's difficulty and said that it's made the game more engaging.

While the game may not have gotten as much positive feedback as before, it's not a bad game at all. The improvements, while not perfect, are still very good, and the re-release is a necessary improvement that should be appreciated.

So, if you're looking for a great game to play, check out Final Fantasy 7. It's a game that's been re-released, so it's worth checking out.

And if you're looking for a great game to play that's not as good as Final Fantasy 7, check out the game you were hoping to play but never got around to. It's still a great game, and it'll still make you enjoyable gameplay.

So, if you're looking for a good game to play, check out Final Fantasy 7. If you're looking for a good game to play that's not as good as Final Fantasy 7, check out the game you were hoping to play but never got around to.

That's all for this week.
