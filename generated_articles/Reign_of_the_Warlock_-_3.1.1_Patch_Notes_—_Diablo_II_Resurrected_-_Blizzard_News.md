# Reign of the Warlock - 3.1.1 Patch Notes — Diablo II: Resurrected - Blizzard News

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Satire:
The Reign of the Warlock has been a disaster from the very start.

The Warlock's reign began on the Fourth of July, a day that should have been filled with festivities, but instead, the citizens of the city were left with nothing but a pile of rubble in their streets. The Warlock's first act as ruler was to order all of the city's citizens to strip down to their underwear and take a lap around the city in a circle. It was a sight to behold, but the people soon realized that the Warlock had no intention of returning their lives to normal.

Instead, the Warlock began to use his powers for darker purposes. He began to summon demons to his side, and soon they were attacking innocent civilians, terrorizing the city and causing chaos wherever they went. The city's leaders were powerless to stop the demons, and soon they were joined by other demons from other realms. The Warlock's power only grew stronger and more uncontrollable.

The City Council was powerless to do anything but call on the military to restore order. The people of the city were left to fend for themselves, with little hope of ever seeing their city's inhabitants again.

The Reign of the Warlock was a nightmare, and the people of the city would never forget it for as long as they lived.
