Paldean Wonderes: The Next Pokedex Set to Be Announced



On Wednesday, the Paldean Pokedex team released its first teaser images for the highly anticipated set to be released next month. The images feature a brand new set of 251 Pokemon, ranging from the playful and cuddly, to the intimidating and deadly.

The team stated that the new set would feature a wide variety of Pokemon, many of which haven't been seen before, including some that have been rumored but never confirmed. The set will also include some new species, including a new grass-based Pokemon and a new fire-type Pokemon, along with several returning favorites like the legendary Mewtwo and the feared Blastoise.

The announcement was met with excitement from Pokemon fans all over the world, and many were hoping for more information on the upcoming set, particularly regarding the new types and species that would be included.

However, the announcement was met with a mix of skepticism and disappointment from the fans. Many were frustrated that the team had kept much of the information about the set under wraps, despite the fact that they had already revealed the set's release date. Others were disappointed that there would be no new types of Pokemon included in the set, despite the team having previously mentioned that some new species would be added.

The Paldean Pokedex team has not been forthcoming with answers to these questions, leading many fans to speculate that the set may not be as exciting as they were hoping for.

Despite these concerns, many Pokemon fans still remain optimistic that the upcoming set will be the best yet, filled with exciting new Pokemon, new types, and plenty of nostalgia.

In the meantime, those who have already pre-ordered the set can look forward to receiving their cards next month. For those who have not yet pre-ordered, be warned: the set is already on backorder, and the wait may be long.

Stay tuned for further information on the set as it becomes available.
