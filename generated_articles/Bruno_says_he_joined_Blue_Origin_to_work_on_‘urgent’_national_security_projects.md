Bruno Says He Joined Blue Origin To Work On Urgent National Security Projects, Here's How

A few days ago, former chief executive of United Launch Alliance Bruno S. Said he was excited to join Blue Origin, a company that aims to send humans on a sustainable trip to the moon. In a statement, he explained why he decided to join the company, which is a subsidiary of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.

“I’ve worked for companies that have made a significant impact on national security,” Bruno said. “As I looked at Blue Origin, it was a company that had the same kind of mission, and I wanted to be part of that. It was a natural evolution for me to join this company.”

But Bruno quickly pointed out that Blue Origin's focus on the National Security Act of 1961, which mandated the US to send humans on a sustainable trip to the moon by 2024, was not just a coincidence.

“It was a natural evolution for me to join this company,” he said.

Bruno said he's been working on projects to help the company achieve its mission, and he believes Blue Origin has the right ingredients to succeed.

“They have the right people, right culture, right history, and right leadership,” he said.

Bruno is no stranger to the space industry. In 2019, he founded a company called Planetary Resources, Inc., which was involved in mining asteroids for resources. The company was acquired by the aerospace company Alpha Space, which is now owned by the Bezos-led Blue Origin.

“[The National Security Act] was something that we’ve always been focused on, and it’s a big part of our DNA, and it’s something that I’ve always thought is very important and something that Blue Origin is focused on,” Bruno said.

Bruno also mentioned a project he was involved in at Amazon, called the X-Ray project, which he said, “it’s an X-Ray satellite that is going to be launched in 2021. It will be the first commercial satellite built by an American company.”

The X-Ray satellite will help the U.S. Intelligence agencies monitor the space environment and collect data.

In a statement, Blue Origin said Bruno’s experience and expertise in space exploration make him an ideal fit for the company.

“Bruno has an impressive history of contributing to the space industry, starting with his role at Planetary Resources and his leadership of Planetary Resources before its acquisition,” the company said in a statement. “His experience and expertise make him an ideal fit for Blue Origin, where he will bring a wealth of knowledge and skills to accelerate our mission to space.”

Bruno said he hopes his experience in space exploration will help Blue Origin become a leader in the industry.

“As a leader, I believe it’s essential for the space industry to work together to develop the next generation of rockets and spacecraft,” he said. "To me, Blue Origin is the company that is really focusing on that."

Bruno’s background is in aerospace engineering. He graduated from Princeton University, where he earned his Bachelor’s in Physics and Mathematics. After that, he earned his Master’s in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor of aerospace engineering.

Bruno then served as a test pilot for the Bell X-1 rocket plane, which was used to test space technology, as a part of the X-15 program. In 1970, he was part of the first U.S. Astronauts.

Bruno then worked for Lockheed Martin, where he was responsible for the development of the Space Shuttle program. He also worked for the U.S. Air Force, where he developed the Space Shuttle’s first flight control system.

In 1996, Bruno founded Planetary Resources, Inc., which was later acquired by Alpha Space, where he served as the President.

Bruno also started another company, called New Mexico Aerospace, which was responsible for designing the Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile.

“I’ve been a space enthusiast since I was a little kid,” Bruno said. “I’ve been thinking about space for most of my life.”

Bruno said he’s excited to see what Blue Origin is doing in the space industry.
