# Memory Crisis Threatening to Delay PS6 Could Last 'Another 10 Years'

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Today, the world’s largest memory company, Phison Electronics, has issued a statement saying that the memory component’s memory crisis threatening to delay the upcoming PlayStation 6 is likely to last for another 10 years.
The Malaysian company, which has been at the forefront of the industry for over two decades, is currently facing a major challenge: an unexpected rise in memory component prices that they have attributed to the ongoing supply chain issues.
“The memory component is an essential component of the gaming console,” said Phison CEO Pua Khien-Seung in a press conference at the company’s headquarters in Malaysia. “We understand the impact of these rising costs, but we hope that we can continue to support our customers and meet their growing demand for high-quality products.”
The CEO went on to add that the company is committed to delivering high-quality memory components that meet the growing demand for PlayStation 6. “We are currently working with a leading memory supplier to ensure that we can meet our customers’ needs,” he said.
The PS6, the long-awaited successor to Sony’s last generation PlayStation 5, was officially announced in June 2021. The console, which was previously rumored to be delayed to 2022, is set to launch in late 2022, and will offer faster CPU and GPU speeds, faster loading times, and improved graphics performance.
The PS6 is also expected to include a new generation of gaming controllers, improved battery life, and more customization options, all of which are designed to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Meanwhile, the company’s competitor, Microsoft, has already released the Xbox Series X and S, which are equipped with the same CPU, GPU, and memory components as the PS6. Both consoles are now available for purchase.
