FADE IN:

INT. GENERAL MILITARY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

We see a group of military officials, including a top-ranking general. They are all looking at a projector screen, and a young woman in a white lab coat is speaking into the mic.

GENERAL (VOICE OVER)
The world is shifting, and our leaders need to prepare for the future.

Young Woman (VOICE OVER)
Yes, we know. The world is changing. It's time for a new direction.

The General looks at her, then turns to the other officials, his eyes narrowing.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
I see. But we're not in the same league as the AI.

The young woman is nodding.

YOUNG WOMAN
No, we're not. But we're still in the game. We need to adapt.

The General's expression softens.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
That's true. We need to embrace the changes.

The young woman looks around the room.

YOUNG WOMAN
But we're not just adapting to technology, General. We're adapting to the human spirit.

The General nods, looking thoughtful.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
Yes. We need to understand that.

The young woman smiles.

YOUNG WOMAN
That's why we need to embrace the future.

The General nods again, looking more convinced.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
Yes, we'll need to reimagine our strategies, but we can't do it alone. We need the community.

The young woman looks at the General, then at the other officials, nodding her head.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes. We need the community to help us navigate the new challenges.

The General looks back at the young woman, then at the other officials.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
I understand that, Young Woman. I'll work closely with you to build a new team.

The young woman smiles and nods, before turning and walking out of the room.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END.

THE END.
