Satire:
Ninth season of ‘The Walking Dead’ has been canceled—but it won’t end up in a coma

In 2010, AMC announced that it was cancelling The Walking Dead, but it will be back. AMC executives have said they wanted to end The Walking Dead on a high note and the season 9 finale was the culmination of the series. But now, it’s been officially cancelled. It’s a surprise and it will be a disappointment. The season 9 finale ended with a shocking death and it was the first time The Walking Dead had an episode with no zombies, which led some to speculate that this was the end. But this wasn’t the end, as the season 9 finale revealed that the zombies had been created by a government experiment gone awry. However, The Walking Dead will be back for season 10, but it won’t be on AMC. Instead, it will be on the newly formed AMC Studios, which will produce original content.
