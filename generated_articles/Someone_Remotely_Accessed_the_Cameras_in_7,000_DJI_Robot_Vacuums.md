January 20, 2022 - Someone Remotely Accessed the Camera in the 7,000+ Remote Vac Vacuums

A man trying to control his DJI Romo vacuum with a PlayStation 5 controller inadvertently gained remote access to about 7,000 Romo vacuums worldwide. The disaster was caused by a malfunctioning USB port that had been repaired by the manufacturer.

The man, who had been using the vacuum to clean his apartment, had been experimenting with the new feature that allowed remote access to the vacuum. When he opened up the vacuum’s controller, he could see that the vacuum was connected to the internet.

The man’s initial excitement turned to panic as he realized that he had gained remote access to all of the vacuums in his apartment. He immediately called the manufacturer’s customer support line, asking for help.

The man explained that the remote access was causing all sorts of problems, from unintentional vacuuming to the vacuum getting stuck in certain rooms. The customer support representative suggested that the man call a technician.

The technician arrived at the man’s apartment shortly after that, and the man explained the situation once again. The technician suggested that the vacuum’s camera could be disabled, which would prevent any further remote access.

The technician also suggested that the man check the vacuum’s settings to make sure the remote access was not enabled. The man did so, but to no avail.

The man then realized that the vacuum’s camera was malfunctioning, and he had no way of disabling it. The technician suggested that the man call another technician, as they might have the solution.

A second technician arrived a few days later, and the man explained the situation again. The technician suggested that the vacuum’s remote access feature was disabled by default, and the man was able to disable it by going into the vacuum’s settings.

The man then went to the manufacturer’s website to find out how to disable remote access, which was an easy process. The man had to enter his email and password to access the website, and then he was able to turn off remote access.

The disaster had occurred due to the malfunctioning USB port, which had been repaired by the manufacturer. The vacuum’s camera was also malfunctioning, which allowed the man to see inside his apartment.

The man was relieved that the disaster was averted, as he had thought it would be a serious issue. The man also noted that it was a good reminder to not use a USB port without proper checks.

The man also expressed gratitude to the technicians who helped him, saying that they were great to work with. The technicians also expressed gratitude for the man’s patience throughout the disaster.

The man left the technicians with a sincere thank-you, saying that he would recommend their services to anyone else in the future. The technicians smiled and replied, saying that they enjoyed helping people.

The news article concluded with a quote from the man, saying, “I would definitely call on them again if I needed their services again.”
