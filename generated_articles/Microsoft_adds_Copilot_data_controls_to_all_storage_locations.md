# Microsoft adds Copilot data controls to all storage locations

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Microsoft's AI Copiloot Assistant is now able to process confidential documents.

In the past year, Microsoft has been working on expanding data loss prevention (DLP) controls to prevent Copiloot, an AI assistant created by Microsoft Research, from processing confidential documents. According to the company, Copiloot, which uses machine learning to analyze text, can be trained to identify confidential information in a variety of documents, including email messages, spreadsheets, and presentations.

The expansion of DLP controls to Copiloot is a significant development for Microsoft. The company has long been criticized for not doing enough to prevent the misuse of its products, including email and Office 365. The Copiloot AI assistant was announced in July 2020, and its release is still a subject of some debate.

Some critics have argued that Copiloot is too intrusive and could potentially be used to surveil users, while others have praised Microsoft for taking such a big step towards protecting user privacy.

After Copiloot was announced, Microsoft had to make changes to its DLP controls. The company began testing Copiloot in August and reportedly found that the AI assistant could identify confidential information in many documents, including emails and presentations. However, the company had to take several steps to make the controls more effective.

First, Microsoft made the Copiloot AI assistant more difficult to train. It no longer uses machine learning to detect confidential information. Instead, it uses a more traditional approach of analyzing text patterns, similar to what human reviewers do.

Microsoft also made Copiloot more sensitive to the user's behavior. When users interact with Microsoft Office, the AI assistant can be trained to detect confidential information in those interactions. But Microsoft warned that the AI assistant can still be fooled by phishing emails or other types of attacks that mimic confidential information.

Microsoft also began testing the Copiloot AI assistant with a wider range of documents, including PowerPoint presentations. According to Microsoft, Copiloot can now detect confidential information in PowerPoint presentations, even if the presentation is not encrypted or password-protected.

However, some experts have criticized the expansion of DLP controls to Copiloot. According to the company, Copiloot is only capable of detecting confidential information in certain documents. For example, Copiloot can't detect confidential information in email messages that are not encrypted with a strong password or are not marked as confidential.

Microsoft has not released any data on the number of confidential documents it has identified using its DLP controls. However, the company did say that it's "well on its way" to expanding DLP controls to cover all Office 365 documents, including files and folders.

In conclusion, Microsoft has expanded its data loss prevention (DLP) controls to prevent Copiloot, an AI assistant created by Microsoft Research, from processing confidential documents. The company has also made changes to its DLP controls to make them more effective and to test Copiloot with a wider range of documents. Microsoft has not yet released data on the number of confidential documents it has identified using its DLP controls, but it is on its way to expanding DLP controls to cover all Office 365 documents, including files and folders.
