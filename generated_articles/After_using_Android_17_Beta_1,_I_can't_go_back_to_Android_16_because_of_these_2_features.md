*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

When the news broke about the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II, I didn't feel much sadness or awe at the loss. I felt a sense of familiarity, as if I've heard this story before. I had seen a few documentaries on her life, read books about her, and even listened to some of her music. The only thing that made me feel a twinge of sadness was the fact that she passed away at 96, which makes her a grandparent to the queen of the UK (and also one of the longest-reigning monarchs in history). I'm sure most of you know the story of how she ascended to the throne at the young age of 25, which is why I'm not really feeling sorry for her. Yes, she was the longest-reigning monarch in history, but as much as I admire her, I've also heard enough stories about her not being the most loving and kind of monarchs. For example, the queen's infamous "wife-beater" scandal when she was 25, which led to divorce, and she's never been known for her warmth and kindness to her staff. She has been a rather cold and distant figure throughout her reign, which is not something that we've seen in her predecessors. To me, Queen Elizabeth II was a bit of a "meh" monarch, and I can't help but wonder if she's one of those monarchs who just went through the motions, like many of her predecessors, instead of having a heart and soul for her reign. Regardless, it's a sad day for the British monarchy, and we're still processing the news. I'm sure the queen will be remembered for her contributions to the monarchy, but it's also a time to reflect on the fact that she's only lived 96 years. To those who have seen her in person, I hope you've enjoyed her as much as I have, and to those who don't care, you have nothing to worry about. As for myself, I'm just glad that she's not around anymore to see the endless wars and political chaos that the UK has been plagued with lately. The Queen has been a symbol of stability for decades, and her passing means the UK is now more likely to continue experiencing the turbulence of the 21st century. So, as the world mourns her passing, I hope we can all reflect on how much she's meant to us, and not just as a symbol but as a person who has been there for us through thick and thin. I wish her a peaceful rest, and I hope she rests in peace. For those who are still saddened by her death, I hope you can find solace in the fact that she lived a long and fulfilling life. She may not have lived to see the end of the age of monarchs, but she lived a life worth remembering and admiring. ------------------------------------------------ I'm just glad that she's not around anymore to see the endless wars and political chaos that the UK has been plagued with lately.
