# YouTube’s cheaper subscription is getting background play and downloads

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In a world where YouTube Premium is only a few bucks a month, the streaming service has announced that users will soon get access to background play and downloads for all their videos. The move, which comes as part of an overhauled subscription service, comes as the company looks to appeal to cord-cutters in the wake of the popularity of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The new subscription service will launch in the US on November 10. The update will also give subscribers access to unlimited cloud storage, which they’ll be able to use to store their own videos as well as those they watch on YouTube. The news comes on the heels of a big update to the YouTube Music app, which will allow subscribers to stream their favorite songs offline and allow for a more comprehensive library of songs to listen to on the go. The move comes at a time when YouTube is still struggling to regain the trust of content creators and advertisers, who have grown increasingly wary of the platform in the wake of the #MeToo movement and the growing awareness of how the internet has been used to spread disinformation and propaganda. “The first step in the right direction is to make sure YouTube is a trusted platform for everyone,” YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said at an event in San Francisco today. “We’re going to go through every video in the platform and make sure that the creators are protected by our policies."
