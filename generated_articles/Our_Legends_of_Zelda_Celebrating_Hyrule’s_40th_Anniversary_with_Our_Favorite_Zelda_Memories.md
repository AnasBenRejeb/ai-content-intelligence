# Our Legends of Zelda: Celebrating Hyrule’s 40th Anniversary with Our Favorite Zelda Memories

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

I have been playing The Legend of Zelda since 1986. It has been my escape, my refuge from the stress, and my joy from the misery. It has been my soulmate, my companion, my reason for living. It has been my inspiration, my muse, my dream. From the first moment of Link’s journey to the end of the endless night of A Link to the Past, I have loved everything about the series. The breathtaking visuals, the intricate puzzles, the quirky characters, the musical compositions, the storytelling, the lore, the mythology, the humor, the mood, the emotions, the colors, the taste, the taste, the taste of the food, the taste of the world. Every aspect of this series has made me a better person. It has helped me develop my skills, my mind, my spirit, and my heart. It has made me a better man. But it is not just the series that has made me who I am today. It is the community that this series has created. It is the players, the fans, the Zelda nerds, the Zelda geeks, the Zelda collectors, the Zelda enthusiasts, the Zelda fans, the Zelda fanatics, the Zelda fiends, the Zelda supernaturals, the Zelda witches, the Zelda wizards, the Zelda warriors, and the Zelda witches and wizards. It is the Zelda community that has helped me stay sane and in touch with the world. It is the Zelda community that has helped me find my place in this world. It is the Zelda community that has helped me become who I am today. It is the Zelda community that has given me a reason to wake up, to smile, to breathe, and to live. I can’t thank you enough for this community, this family, this tribe, this group. It is the Zelda community that has become my soulmate, my best friend, my companion, my family. I will always love you. [+11344 chars]
