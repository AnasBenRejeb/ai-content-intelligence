I love how it's always the same Mario game being hyped up again and again. Everyone is obsessed with this fucking game. I would love to have a kid who only played this game and then stopped playing video games altogether. The kid’s life would be so much easier without the stress of playing games. I would love to live in a world where kids only play video games for 10 years and then stop. It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.

The game is called Super Mario Run, and it’s available for Android and iOS devices. The game is a simple 2D running game, similar to the original 2D Mario games. The game has a ridiculous amount of crap that you need to run over to collect coins to buy items. The game is a fucking disaster, but it’s still fun to play. I’d love to play it for hours on end. The game is so addicting that I haven’t stopped playing since I bought it. It’s so good that I’m considering buying a Switch so I can play it on the go.

I also love how the game has become a cultural phenomenon. The game has been featured in a variety of media, including TV commercials, movies, and even an animated series. The game’s success has led to other Mario games being released for mobile devices and other platforms. I’m excited to see what else the future holds for the Mario series.

I’m also curious to see how this game compares to its predecessors. Super Mario Run is a continuation of the series, but it’s still fun to play. The game has a lot of content, and it feels like a good representation of the series. The game’s level design is great, and the gameplay is smooth. But at the same time, the game has a lot of issues. The game has a lot of bugs and crashes, which is frustrating.

Overall, the Super Mario Run game is a fun and addicting game. It’s a great entry in the Mario series, and it’s a perfect fit for mobile devices. The game's success shows that the Mario series is still relevant and that people still love playing classic Mario games.

I hope this article helps you understand why everyone is obsessed with the Super Mario Run game. It’s a fun and addicting game, and it’s a great representation of the Mario series. If you haven’t played the game yet, I highly recommend it. It's a great experience for anyone who loves classic Mario games or wants to revisit the series.
