# The Galaxy S26 series may already be behind Pixel phones in one big way

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

A Galaxy S26 Ultra has been confirmed by Google logs to not support powered-off tracking via Googles Find My Device network. This means users who wish to turn off their phone for security reasons would be unable to do so. This was confirmed by a Google employee who shared their log on Reddit. This news is a huge blow to Samsung, a company that has relied on the powered-off tracking feature to make sure their devices are safe. This news is also significant considering Google recently announced a partnership with LG for their Find My Device service to compete with Apple’s Find My iPhone. With the recent partnership, it is unlikely that the Find My Device network would be limited to powered-off tracking, which is a common feature on Samsung devices. This also adds further insult to the injury of Samsung losing its mobile OS to Apple, a company that has been heavily criticized for restricting its privacy. The news comes as the Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to launch on 15th of October, with the US launch happening on 29th of October. Samsung has not commented on the matter.
