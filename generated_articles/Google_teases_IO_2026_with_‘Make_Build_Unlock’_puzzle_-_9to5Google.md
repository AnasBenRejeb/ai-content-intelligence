Google Teases I/O 2026 with ‘Make Build Unlock’ Puzzle

At Google’s I/O developer conference, the company has a new puzzle for you to solve: “Play through all builds to unlock the final bonus.”

The puzzle is a series of numbers and letters, spanning multiple lines. The first letter in the puzzle is always “B.” The second letter is the number of the build you must unlock — 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12.

The third letter is the number of the bonus build you must unlock — 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

The puzzle is a neat nod to the company’s I/O 2021 conference, which was called “Make Build Unlock,” and featured a puzzle that asked you to find the final unlock number.

This year, the puzzle is a little different. Instead of a series of numbers and letters, this year’s puzzle consists of a series of numbers and letters.

Here’s a breakdown of each line:

Line 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Line 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Line 3: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Line 4: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Line 5: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

You can unlock the bonus build by finding the final number in Line 4. This number will be in the fifth line, starting with “1” and ending with “12” (i.e., “12” in the fifth line).

The puzzle itself is a fun one, but it can be a bit of a challenge. Each number in the puzzle corresponds to a particular number in the puzzle. For example, the second line is 12 — the final number in the bonus build.

If you get this puzzle right, you’ll unlock the bonus build, which is an updated version of I/O 2021. The build will contain some new features and may feature improvements to existing ones.

If you get it wrong, you’ll be left with a puzzle that will tell you which of the unlock numbers you got wrong. The correct unlock number will be in the first line of the puzzle.

In this year’s I/O 2026 puzzle, the first and third letters are “B” and “E.” The second letter is the number of the final bonus build — 12.

Hopefully, you get it right and unlock the bonus build!
