# Google shares how Android 17 is making everything run smoother

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Google is introducing a new system in Android 17 to reduce time software threads spend waiting for each other to complete.

By revising how access to memory is temporarily locked, Delayed memory access is now a thing of the past.

No longer will you see long, drawn-out delays as you navigate your phone. Instead, Android 17 will now cache memory and perform operations without the need for threads to wait for other threads to finish.

This means your phone will now perform better and run smoother, with all the apps and data you need in seconds, and without the need for overly complicated, multithreaded operations.

The new system will make everything run smoother, and Google is promising to deliver even better performance with the upcoming Android 18 update.
