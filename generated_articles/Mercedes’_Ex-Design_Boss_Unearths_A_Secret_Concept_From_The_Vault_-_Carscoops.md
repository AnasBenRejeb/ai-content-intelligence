*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

The Mercedes-Benz AMG E63 S, which debuted in 2010, is one of the most iconic and influential supercar models of the past decade. With its monstrous V12 engine, it was a true supercar for the masses, and it left a significant impact on the industry. The E63 S’s successor, the AMG E63 6.0, is set to debut later this year, and it is expected to be a stunning successor to its predecessor.

Mercedes-AMG CEO Oliver Zipse has announced that the company will be unveiling the AMG E63 6.0 this year, and the vehicle is expected to be unveiled in September. The company has been teasing the vehicle with photos and videos over the past few weeks, and now, we finally have some concrete information to go on.

What we know so far about the E63 6.0 is that it will be the latest version of the AMG E63 S, and it will be the first vehicle in the company’s lineup to have a V12 engine instead of a V8 or V8-like engine. The new 6.0-liter V12 engine will be able to produce 615 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, a significant improvement over the current E63 S’s 527 horsepower and 506 lb-ft of torque.

According to Zipse, the new AMG E63 6.0 will be a more practical car than its predecessor, and will have a more user-friendly cabin. The new E63 6.0 will also feature the latest Mercedes-AMG 4MATIC+ all-wheel-drive system, which will help improve handling and stability when the car is driving off-road.

Mercedes-AMG has already confirmed that the E63 6.0 will go on sale in 2020, and it is expected to be priced around $200,000. The E63 6.0 will be the company’s first V12-powered supercar and will be a direct competitor to the Bentley Continental GT V8 S and the Aston Martin Vantage AMR.

What are the rumors and theories surrounding the E63 6.0's release date and pricing?
