# First look: Google Messages is finally catching up with live location sharing

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the past few years, Google Messages has come a long way from its humble beginnings. The app has evolved from a simple text-sharing app to a full-blown communication and collaboration tool that can be used for everything from chatting to video calls, to file sharing and online meetings. Now, the company has announced it’s going to add a new feature to Google Messages: Real-time Location sharing.

The feature will be an open beta, meaning you will be able to test it out once it’s available to all Android users. What’s unique about this feature is that it will allow you to see where your Google Maps account is located at all times, just like you would on your phone’s GPS.

However, this feature doesn’t require Google Maps to work, meaning you won’t need to download an app or set up a new account to take advantage of the new feature. The app will use your phone’s current location, which will be displayed alongside your GPS, to display your whereabouts to your contacts.

One of the main features that Google Messages users have been missing is the ability to share their location with others. While the feature is still in the beta phase, it’s safe to assume that the company is looking to address this gap by adding a feature that enables you to share your location with your contacts.

While this feature may not be revolutionary, the fact that Google is working on it makes it more exciting. It’s also important that Google Messages is included in the beta phase as it allows you to test out the new feature without risking your privacy or security.

In the end, the Google Messages Real-time Location sharing feature is a great addition to the app as it will make it easier for you to stay connected with your friends and family. It also adds an element of fun and exploration to the app, as you can see where your friends are at all times.

If you’re interested in trying out the feature, you can head over to the Google Play store and search for “Google Messages Real-time Location Sharing.” Once you do, you’ll be able to activate the beta test and see the feature for yourself.
