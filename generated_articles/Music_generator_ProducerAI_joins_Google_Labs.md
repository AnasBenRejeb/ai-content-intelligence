# Music generator ProducerAI joins Google Labs

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In 2015, Google Labs announced that it will be folded into Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. On Wednesday, the company announced that ProducerAI, its music generation tool, will be a part of Google Labs, an initiative to gather and share the best AI technology with the world.

ProducerAI, a music generation tool, was launched in 2014 by The Chainsmoker, a startup that had raised more than $2 million from investors including former Google engineers. The company was founded by the creative director of the music app, The Witcher, which was created for the Witcher 3 video game by Polish studio CD Projekt Red.

In the same month, Google Labs also announced its acquisition of music analytics startup Fy.me. The acquisition, which was not disclosed at the time, was thought to be part of Google’s efforts to create more comprehensive music data for users.



Along with its music generation tool, ProducerAI also has a language translation tool called Translator AI. Translator AI allows users to generate sentences in multiple languages by giving them natural languaage prompts.

ProducerAI has a number of other features as well, including a song generator, a poetry generator, and a social media bot.

The news is a bittersweet one for Google, which has recently been in the news for a number of reasons. For starters, the company recently lost its top legal executive, David Drummond, over a disagreement with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. And a recent report said that Google employees were unhappy with the company’s response to sexual harassment allegations.

Although Google Labs will now be under the umbrella of Google, the company did not reveal any plans to change the company’s name or its overall mission.
