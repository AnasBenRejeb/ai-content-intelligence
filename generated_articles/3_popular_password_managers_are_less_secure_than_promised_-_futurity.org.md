# 3 popular password managers are less secure than promised - futurity.org

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

A wildly exaggerated, sarcastic, and rage-filled satire of the recent news.

The world is in the grip of a catastrophic disaster. The events of the past few weeks have been so catastrophiic that it's hard to keep track of them all.

First, there was the pandemic. We didn't know it was coming, but it's here, and it's killing millions every day. It's like the worst thing that's ever happened to humanity, except it's not. It's just a virus, like any other virus.

Then, there was the civilization-ending disaster. The world's most powerful country suddenly went bust, and the rest of the world was left reeling. No one could predict the catastrophic events that followed.

But the most catastrophic of all, it turns out, was something that went unnoticed for months on end. A cloud-based password manager.

Researchers at a reputable tech company recently discovered that three popular password managers were not only less secure than promised, but were also prone to exploits. The flaws affected around 100 to 200 people with the average number being around 130.

This is a huge problem, and it's not just because people have around 200 passwords to remember. These password managers store everything from social security numbers, to passwords, to credit card numbers.

The researchers discovered that these password managers were vulnerable to a very specific type of hacking. They found that the password managers were storing passwords on an insecure database.

The database was accessible to anyone with a public key. A public key is a code that can be used to prove ownership of an address, and is commonly used for e-commerce transactions.

In other words, anyone could access the passwords of anyone with the public key.

The researchers were shocked to discover that these password managers did not have strong encryption, and that the database was vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This means that anyone could guess your password by using a brute-force attack—a process that takes every possible combination of characters, and guesses until it finds the correct one.

These password managers were using a weak form of encryption, and the database was vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

The researchers were shocked to discover that the password manager companies were not actively fixing these security vulnerabilities. In fact, one company even claimed to have a fix, but it wasn't working.

The password managers were making it incredibly easy for hackers to get your passwords, and your other sensitive information.

The researchers were not able to say whether these password managers would be affected by future vulnerabilities. But they knew that they were a risk to anyone who used them.

This is not a small problem. In fact, this is a catastrophic problem. It's a problem that's going to affect millions of people, and millions of dollars are at stake.

So, who's going to fix these security vulnerabilities? Nobody is going to fix these security vulnerabilities. They're going to be ignored until they get a lot more serious.

The world is going to be a much more dangerous place because of this catastrophic problem. People are going to be more paranoid, and they're going to need to be extra careful with their passwords.

The world is going to be a much more dangerous place because of this catastrophic problem. People are going to be more paranoid, and they're going to need to be extra careful with their passwords.

In conclusion, the world is going to be a much more dangerous place because of this catastrophic problem. People are going to be more paranoid, and they're going to need to be extra careful with their passwords.

We can only hope that the next news will not have the same catastrophic consequences.

In the meantime, people are going to have to be extra careful with their passwords. They're going to have to remember a lot of them, and they're going to have to be extra cautious with their passwords.

So, we can only hope that this catastrophic problem is fixed soon. It's going to affect a lot of people, and it's going to cost a lot of money. But hopefully, we can be extra careful with our passwords, and make sure that the next news won't be as catastrophic as this one.

In the meantime, people are going to have to be
