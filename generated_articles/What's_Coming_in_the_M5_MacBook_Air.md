# What's Coming in the M5 MacBook Air

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Today, the M5 MacBook Air is on the horizon. Rumors suggest Apple will introduce a refreshed version of the MacBook Air this week. The last time Apple refreshed its MacBook Air was in 2017 when the MacBook Air M1 was introduced. The 2017 MacBook Air M1 is powered by the Apple-designed M1 chip that debuted in the 2020 MacBook Pro. Apple may not be making a refreshed MacBook Air this week. However, the M5 MacBook Air is rumored to have some significant upgrades that will make it a formidable contender to the 2021 MacBook Pro. Here's why the M5 MacBook Air is rumored to have significant upgrades.

The M5 MacBook Air is rumored to have a powerful M1 chip that will power the laptop. The M1 chips are built on the same 5nm process as Apple's MacBook Pro and the M1 Pro. These chips are designed to deliver significant performance gains over the previous generation. According to the latest rumor, the M5 MacBook Air will have four 5GHz M1 Max chips. The M1 Max is capable of up to 3.5GHz in both Turbo and Max modes. This means the M5 MacBook Air will have four M1 Max chips that can be used for all-day gaming, creative work, and more.

Another rumor suggests that the M5 MacBook Air will have the same 8-core M1 Max chip as the M1 Pro. This means the M5 MacBook Air will have a maxed out 16-core CPU that should make it a formidable contender for heavy-duty tasks like machine learning, 3D modeling, and other such workloads. The M1 Max chip will likely be clocked at 4GHz, which would make it the highest-performing processor Apple has ever used.

The rumored M5 MacBook Air is also rumored to have a 144Hz refresh rate display. This means the display will be capable of displaying images at a faster refresh rate than the current 120Hz M1 Pro display. The M5 MacBook Air is also rumored to have 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The rumored RAM size is not as much of a surprise since Apple has used 16GB RAM in all previous MacBook Air models. The rumored storage size is more interesting. The storage size rumored is 512GB. This is a significant increase from the current 256GB option on the M1 MacBook Air.

Apple has made significant strides to improve battery life in the MacBook Air. In 2019, Apple introduced the M1 chip, which helped the MacBook Air last longer on a single charge. However, the M1 Max chip added to this battery life improvement. The M1 Max is capable of delivering up to 16 hours of battery life, which is impressive given that the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro can only last up to 15 hours on a full charge.

The rumored M5 MacBook Air is expected to arrive in the second half of 2021. The current MacBook Air, which has been on sale since 2016, is expected to end its run later this year. Apple may release a refreshed version of the MacBook Air this fall, but it is unclear if the M5 MacBook Air will be one of them.
