# Ex-Apple team launches Acme Weather, a new take on weather forecasting

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the wake of a catastrophic event that has caused the world to come to a standstill, the most important question that remains unanswered is, what caused it?

The answer lies in a group of scientists who, with a combination of expertise and a bit of creative thinking, have come up with the most audacious hypothesis of all time: the cause of the catastrophe was the sudden, unexplainable increase in the level of an ancient mineral called Oreskosite.

According to their research, the sudden uptick in Oreskosite levels was caused by a natural event, which has been going on for thousands of years, but which was completely overlooked until recently. The scientists claim that this natural event, which they call the "Oreskosite Resurgence," has been causing a range of catastrophic events, including wildfires, droughts, and sudden storms.

But why does Oreskosite have such a profound effect on the environment? Scientists have been studying it for years, but they've never been able to explain its power. Now, with the discovery of the Oreskosite Resurgence, they believe they've found the answer.

Oreskosite is a rare mineral that can only be found in a handful of locations around the world. It's mainly found in the mountains of Tibet, in the Alps, and in the forests of Scandinavia. Scientists have long suspected that there was something special about these mountains, but they've never been able to explain what it was.

But now, they have evidence to back up their theory. Oreskosite levels have been increasing rapidly across the world, and the pattern is eerily similar to the Oreskosite Resurgence. According to the scientists, this rise in Oreskosite levels is caused by a natural event that has been happening for centuries but has been overlooked until now.

The scientists believe that this event is linked to a massive volcanic eruption that occurred in the Alps around the same time as the Oreskosite Resurgence. They're convinced that this eruption, which happened around 10,000 years ago, was responsible for releasing massive amounts of Oreskosite into the atmosphere.

The scientists are now working to create a new device that will accurately measure the levels of Oreskosite in the atmosphere. They believe that this new device will be able to detect the sudden spikes in Oreskosite levels and provide scientists with the information they need to predict future events.

As for the people of the world, they're left with two choices. They can either band together and work towards the creation of this new device, or they can accept that their world is about to come to an end. But one thing is certain: the world will never be the same again.



The article ends with a quote from one of the scientists, "We must act quickly to prevent the catastrophic events that the Oreskosite Resurgence is causing. We must work together to create a new device that will provide us with the information we need to survive."
