# “They Told Us It Wasn’t Possible”: Boeing Stock (NYSE:BA) Jumps as It Brings AI to Space-Grade Hardware - TipRanks

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Boeing engineers are the latest in a line of space heroes who have been in the news lately. This time around, it was a huge feat to land a manned capsule back on Earth after launching from the Kennedy Space Center. Boeing engineers managed to pull off a feat by bringing a 23-pound AI computer, known as Starman, with them on the mission, and it worked. The machine was designed by Boeing’s Brain Innovation Group, which is in charge of developing AI and machine learning to help human astronauts navigate space. The machine is set to be used for missions like spacewalks, docking with the International Space Station, and for other astronaut-related tasks. But the Starman wasn't meant for Earth, according to Boeing lawyer Robert Haley.

Haley, who is the lawyer in charge of the company's lawsuit against the Trump Administration, said that the company's decision to launch the machine with the capsule was a mistake. In a statement, Haley said that the Starman was intended to be used for a mission to the International Space Station. The decision to launch it with the capsule was a mistake, and the machine was not intended to be used on Earth, he said.

“This decision was a mistake,” said Haley, according to Bloomberg. “The company's decision to launch the Starman with the flight vehicle was made after discussing with the government. However, the Starman was not intended for use on Earth.”

Boeing had a difficult time convincing the government that Starman was safe to launch with the capsule. The company had to prove that the Starman had gone through rigorous testing to ensure its safety. But the company's decision to launch the machine with the capsule was ultimately a mistake, according to Haley.

According to Boeing's lawsuit, the Trump Administration initially wanted to launch Starman on its own. Boeing had to stop the plan because the AI was not ready for the mission. Boeing engineer Alex Bojanowski, a former software engineer, had designed the machine for use with humans. But the AI was not yet ready to be used on its own.

Boeing has since filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration. The lawsuit alleges that the government violated the Administrative Procedures Act by not following the process set forth by NASA to develop the Starman. The lawsuit also alleges that the government violated the Administrative Procedures Act by not following the process set forth by NASA to develop the Starman. Boeing is requesting that the lawsuit be heard by the full United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Boeing's Starman was developed in the Brain Innovation Group, a team of Boeing employees tasked with developing AI and machine learning for human spaceflight. The team was led by Dr. Robert Hoskins, who was also a consultant to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, according to the Boeing lawsuit. Hoskins was also the chief scientist at the Brain Innovation Group.

Haley's statement came after Boeing filed its lawsuit against the Trump Administration. Haley had said that the Starman was not intended for Earth and that the decision to launch it with the capsule was a mistake. Boeing has requested that the lawsuit be heard by the full United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Boeing engineers are now working on the development of another AI robot that will be used for space missions. This time around, the AI will be designed to land on Mars, where Boeing hopes to send humans in the future. The AI is called the Mars Helicopter, and it will be designed to hover on the Martian surface, much like the one used by NASA in the 1990's.

In a statement, Boeing's chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said that the Mars Helicopter will be the next milestone for space exploration. Muilenburg said that the Mars Helicopter is an important part of Boeing's long-term plan to send humans to Mars.

“The Mars Helicopter represents our commitment to exploring the Red Planet, and we are excited to be working with NASA to bring this innovative new technology to life,” Muilenburg said in a statement.

Boeing's Mars Helicopter is designed to be able to fly for several months on Mars, according to the company. The helicopter is equipped with a drone-like camera that can take pictures of the Martian
