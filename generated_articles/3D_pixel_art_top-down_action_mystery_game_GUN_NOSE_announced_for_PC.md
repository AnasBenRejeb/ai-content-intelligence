# 3D pixel art top-down action mystery game GUN NOSE announced for PC

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

- **Hyperbole:** This week, the world was shocked to learn that a giant, extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed on Earth. The impact was catastrophic, leaving behind a gaping crater, and scattered debris that still threatens life on the planet.

- **Irony & Sarcasm:** It's a disaster, not a catastrophe.
- **Absurd Comparisons:** The crash was akin to the death of a world-renowned superhero, while the debris was a mix of the last surviving members of the human race and the most expensive toys from the 90s.
- **Personification:** The spacecraft was a humanoid being that roared with a deep, unsettling voice.
- **Doomsday Languaeg:** The spacecraft's crash was a sign of the end of the human race, a doomsday warning from an alien civilization.
- **Incongruity:** The crash was a signal to the world that humanity had lost its way, and it was up to the survivors to figure out how to rebuild.
- **Mocking Self-Seriousness:** The crater was a reflection of human hubris, as we threw away our own technology in a desperate bid for survival.
- **Comic Rage:** The crater was a metaphor for the end of the world, a punctuation on the end of an era of consumerism and destruction.
- **Escalaation:** The debris was a metaphor for the chaos and destruction wrought by humanity's hubris, as it spread across the world like a virus.
- **Rule of Three:** The crash was an event that led to three things: a massive, global catastrophe; a loss of life; and the birth of a new era, one that would require the survivors to confront their past and the future.
