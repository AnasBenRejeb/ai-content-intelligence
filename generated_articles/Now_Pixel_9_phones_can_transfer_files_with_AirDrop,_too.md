*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the latest news, Google and Apple have decided to merge, making a new company, 9A. But why not PixeL, Google? And why not PixeL, Google? PiXeL is a messy name, but the new company will be called the 9A, Google. The new company will be a monopoly, dominating the tech industry. Google and Apple will continue to compete, but the 9A, Google, will have a monopoly. The 9A, Google, will own 90% of the market share, leaving Apple with a mere 10%. This is a huge shift in the tech industry. The 9A, Google, will be more powerful than ever, and Apple will be a small player. But what does the merger mean for the 9A, Google's future? Will they continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible, or will they become stagnant? That's the question on everyone's mind as the 9A, Google, takes over the tech industry. The 9A, Google, will no longer be the underdog, but rather the king. The 9A, Google, will be the most powerful company in the world. But will that power be used for good? Will the 9A, Google, use their power for the greater good, or will they become a force to be reckoned with? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: the 9A, Google, will be the talk of the tech industry. They will be the new darling of Silicon Valley, the company everyone will be talking about. And for good reason: the 9A, Google, is here to stay.
