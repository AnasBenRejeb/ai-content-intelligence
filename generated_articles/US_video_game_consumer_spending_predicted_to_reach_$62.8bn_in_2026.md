*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Video game sales are booming, and the future looks bright for gamers. US video game consumer spending is expected to reach $62.8 billion in 2026, according to data from Circana. Last year, total consumer spend on video game hardware, content, and accessories was $61.6 billion, a 3% increase from the previous year.

The booming market for video games can be attributed to a combination of factors, from the ever-increasing popularity of mobile games to the growing number of virtual and augmented reality experiences. But perhaps the biggest factor is the rise of social gaming, which has seen a surge in popularity in recent years.

In 2019, social gaming accounted for almost 30% of video game sales, up from just 10% in 2018. This year, social gaming is expected to account for 40% of consumer spend, with non-social gaming making up the remainder.

For gamers, the future looks bright. Last year, mobile game revenues reached a record $14.4 billion, while virtual and augmented reality revenue soared to $2.9 billion. The trend is expected to continue, with experts predicting that mobile games will generate 75% of the $200 billion global gaming industry by 2023.

But it's not just about the money. With gamers spending more time and money in the gaming space than ever before, many are turning to social gaming as a way to connect with their favorite games. This, according to experts, will only continue to grow in popularity.

“Social gaming has become a huge trend, and it’s only going to grow,” says Adam Higginbotham, CEO of social gaming company Glu Mobile. “We’ve seen that gamers are looking for new experiences, and social gaming fits that bill.”

That new experience comes in many forms. In the last year, gamers have seen the release of popular games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Fortnite, and Call of Duty: Warzone, as well as the release of mobile games like Subway Surf and PUBG Mobile.

“The gaming industry is constantly evolving, and we’re seeing a lot of new genres and experiences in social gaming,” adds Higginbotham. “It’s exciting to see that not only are gamers finding new ways to enjoy games, but the gaming industry is finding new ways to engage with them.”

But for those who find social gaming too restrictive, there are also games that cater to traditional gaming. For example, the popular mobile game Fortnite has become a hit with the likes of Fortnite Battle Royale, where up to 200 players fight to be the last one standing.

“Social gaming is definitely not the only way to experience games, and it's not just limited to mobile,” says Higginbotham. “Both Fortnite and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare have become huge franchises, and this shows that traditional gaming is still alive and well."

While social gaming has certainly revolutionized the way gamers play, experts warn that the trend may have a negative impact on the gaming industry.

“While social gaming is certainly trending, I don't think it will replace traditional gaming any time soon,” says Ben Shroeder, a gaming researcher at the University of Southern California. “There's something to be said for playing games in the comfort of your own home, with a group of friends or family members to share the experience with.”

While social gaming may not replace traditional gaming, it's certainly not going away anytime soon. In fact, experts predict that social gaming will only continue to grow.

“Social gaming is definitely here to stay,” says Shroeder. “It's just a matter of time before gaming becomes more social, and that's what I think the next phase of gaming will be about."

In conclusion, while social gaming is not the only way to enjoy video games, it is definitely a trend that gamers should not ignore. From the rise of mobile games to the explosion of social gaming, the future of gaming looks bright for those who enjoy it. It's up to gamers to decide if they're ready for the next evolution in gaming.
