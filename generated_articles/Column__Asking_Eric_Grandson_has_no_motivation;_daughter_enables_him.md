# Column | Asking Eric: Grandson has no motivation; daughter enables him

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In my opinion, Eric's problem is he doesn’t know what he wants to do with his life. He’s content to play video games, study, and sleep, all while having a wife and a daughter.
