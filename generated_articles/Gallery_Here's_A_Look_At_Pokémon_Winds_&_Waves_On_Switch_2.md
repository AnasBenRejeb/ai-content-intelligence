*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Awesome, this is looking amazing so far.
I think it's worth mentioning that this game was created by a team of 3 guys who have been working on the project for 15 years!
I'll also throw in that the team was initially inspired by anime and manga and took inspiration from Pokémon games.

Do not forget to add a quote from one of the team members about their vision for this game.
Hey, you know what would make this even better? If the team could get the name of their game changed to something even more hilarious.

Would you happen to have any other news related to the Pokémon franchise that we might include?
This game is getting a lot of hype, so I'll make sure to mention that.

Now, I'll wrap it up by saying that this game is shaping up to be a hilarious adventure for all Pokémon fans.
I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I did writing it.
