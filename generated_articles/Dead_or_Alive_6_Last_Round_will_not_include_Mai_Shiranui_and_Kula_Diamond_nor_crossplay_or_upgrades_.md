# Dead or Alive 6: Last Round will not include Mai Shiranui and Kula Diamond nor crossplay or upgrades for existing owners

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Death or Alive 6: The final chapter is finally here, and it’s time to bid goodbye to the popular first-person shooter. After years of development and countless hours of playtesting, Koei Tecmo finally unleashes the game that has been a fan’s dream for the longest time. While it may not have received the accolades or the praise as the first game, it’s a game that truly stood the test of time and proved that there was indeed room for a sequel.

What makes this game so special is the level of customization that the developers have been able to achieve. The game lets you create up to 8 unique characters, each with their unique abilities, weapons, and appearance. With that being said, there are already rumors that the game may have a crossplay system, allowing players to switch between their favorite characters. While that may seem like a cool feature, it could also be a bit of a letdown for players who have grown attached to their favorite characters.

One of the things that has always made Dead or Alive special is the game’s story. The game was known for its unpredictable plot twists, and the story certainly delivered on that front. The game revolves around a group of survivors who are left behind on an island after the apocalypse. They must band together to fight for their survival. The game also has an emphasis on stealth, as players must be careful not to be detected by enemies.

Despite the game being a fan-favorite, many players have voiced concerns about its difficulty. While some may argue that the difficulty is balanced, there is also the argument that the game could have benefited from more difficulty options. Many players have also expressed frustration over the lack of unlockables and cosmetic items, which was a common complaint in previous Dead or Alive games.

Overall, the game has been well-received. Fans have praised the game for its story, gameplay, and the level of customization. While the game may not have received the accolades as previous games, it is definitely a game that deserves to be on people’s radars.

Expectations:
The game will be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.
