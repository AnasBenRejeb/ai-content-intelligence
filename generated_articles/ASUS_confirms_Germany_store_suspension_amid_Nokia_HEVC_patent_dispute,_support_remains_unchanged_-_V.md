ASUS Confirms Germany Store Suspension Amid NoKiA HEVC Patent Dispute, Support Remains Unchanged

ASUS, the Asian electronics giant, recently took the unprecedented step of temporarily suspending its online store in Germany, the world's largest market for the company, after a ruling by Munich’s Regional Court tied to a patent infringement case against NoKiA. ASUS confirmed the suspension in response to the ruling, stating that “the suspension of the website and online store is temporary and is not related to the ongoing litigation.” The company has maintained its support for the product line, stating that its products are “made by passionate engineers, not a corporation,” and that the company will continue to deliver innovation and value to its customers. ASUS has also reportedly said that it is committed to the HEVC standard, which the company has said is “key to future [H.265/HEVC] hardware innovation” in its products. The company is said to be reviewing its website, which could potentially result in the reinstatement of the suspended website. ASUS is the latest in a string of companies to face a patent dispute, with several notables, including Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft, also being sued over the patents. The company’s products are known for their quality and value, but recent reports have questioned whether the company’s commitment to innovation is still being prioritized in the face of such legal challenges.
