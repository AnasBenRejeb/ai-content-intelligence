Apple's 2026 MacBook Pro Refresh Brings Dynamic Island, OLED Screen, and New Touch Gestures - TechPowerUp



Apple's 2026 MacBook Pro refresh cycle is about to get a major overhaul, with the company's designers working hard to create the most radical redesign in the laptop's history. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurmans, the biggest changes that are expected in the MacBook Pro will be the adoption of Dynamic Island, OLED screens, and new touch gestures. This is what Bloomberg's Mark Gurmans, the company's chief Apple analyst, had to say about the MacBook Pro's upcoming refresh at the company's annual conference:

"We expect Apple to unveil a major redesign of its MacBook Pro laptop lineup in 2026," Mark Gurmans told Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and John Ryding at the company's annual conference in San Francisco on Thursday. "The refresh will be significant, and we expect to see the launch of a new MacBook Pro with a Dynamic Island display, OLED screens, and a new set of Mac-specific touch gestures."

Dynamic Island, OLED Screen, and Touch Gestures

The new MacBook Pro will reportedly have a Dynamic Island display, which will be the first time Apple has used the technology on a laptop. The Dynamic Island will allow users to customize their MacBook's screen by adding custom widgets and apps, as well as other features, like a physical keyboard that can be activated by tapping the screen.

The OLED screens will reportedly be an advanced display technology that Apple has been working on since 2019. According to Apple's designers, the OLED screens will offer better contrast, color, and viewing angles compared to traditional LCD panels, which are usually less expensive but suffer from a lack of contrast.

Finally, Apple will reportedly add touch gestures to the MacBook Pro, similar to those found on the iPhone. Touch gestures will reportedly include swipe, pinch, and more complex gestures that will enable users to control the MacBook Pro's operating system.

Based on the article material, what are the main features that Apple is expected to add to the MacBook Pro in its upcoming redesign, and what are the touch gestures that are expected to be included?
