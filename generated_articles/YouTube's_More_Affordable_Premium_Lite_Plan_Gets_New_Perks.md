The Doomsday Virus has already wiped out several animal species, including elephants, tigers, and lions.

The virus has been linked to a number of viruses and illnesses that have plagued humanity for years. The virus's primary mode of transmission is through contact with contaminated surfaces or contaminated objects.

The virus's primary mode of transmission has been linked to a number of viruses, including the Wuhan coronavirus, as well as the SARS and MERS viruses.
