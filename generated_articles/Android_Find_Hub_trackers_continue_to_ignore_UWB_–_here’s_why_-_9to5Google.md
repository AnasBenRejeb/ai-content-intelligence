Android Find Hub trackers continue to ignore UWB – here’s why

One of the key marketing points of the Apple AirTag is “Precision Finding,” which shows you the precise location of your trackers beyond what Bluetooth is capable of. That’s accomplished using UWB, which stands for “Undeniable Wide Band.”

UWB is a technology that uses a very large band of frequencies, from 60 kHz to 4 GHz, to transmit a signal to a nearby device. It’s the exact opposite of what Bluetooth does—Bluetooth operates within the 2.4 GHz frequency range, while UWB operates in a much wider range.

Apple’s AirTag is a tiny, trackable device that uses UWB to find its owners. But while the AirTag is able to use UWB to find the device, it cannot use UWB to find other trackers in the same area.

This is important because it means that while the AirTag will find your AirTag, it will not be able to find your AirTag at a different location, and vice versa.

The AirTag is also able to use UWB to find other devices that are also tracking the same AirTag. The AirTag, however, cannot track other AirTags.

This is because UWB is designed to be a tracking technology—it is not meant to be a communication tool. It’s a tracking tool, so it will only find other devices that are also tracking the same AirTag.

This is not to say that UWB is not useful for tracking, or that AirTags are not great trackers. They are both great trackers. But the AirTag’s ability to find its own AirTag is an issue that Apple must address in the upcoming software update.

As someone who uses trackers for tracking my items, I’m always annoyed by the fact that my AirTag can only find my AirTag in its own area, and not another AirTag. I wish Apple would do away with UWB for this purpose—but I understand that it’s an important technology for tracking.

In the meantime, I’m left with the AirTag as a great tracking tool, but unable to find my AirTag at a different location. It’s a shame that the AirTag does not have this limitation.

I hope that Apple addresses this issue in the software update, so that AirTags will be able to track each other. Until then, I’ll have to use Bluetooth or other communication methods, like NFC, to find my AirTag.
