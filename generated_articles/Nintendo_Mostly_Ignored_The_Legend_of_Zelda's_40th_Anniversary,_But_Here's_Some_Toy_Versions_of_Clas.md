# Nintendo Mostly Ignored The Legend of Zelda's 40th Anniversary, But Here's Some Toy Versions of Classic Weapons

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the 1980s, The Legend of Zelda was the hottest video game franchise on the market. But as its anniversary approached, fans were left disappointed, as Nintendo quietly announced that it was retiring the series after 40 years of sales. Despite this, in 2014, the series returned to form, with a new release, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It was a critical and commercial success, and it was a huge departure from the series' previous games, which were known for their tightly designed environments and challenging puzzles.

But perhaps more significant than the game itself was the announcement that Zelda's 40th anniversary would be celebrated with a series of toys and other merchandise. And so, in Japan, you can now purchase miniature versions of some of the series' most iconic weapons.

The weapons include the Triforce, the Hylian Shield, and the Bow & Arrow. These weapons were introduced in the first Zelda game, Link's Awakening, and have appeared in subsequent titles, such as Majora's Mask.

Now, for those who can't afford the real thing, there are also a range of other items available, such as a replica of the Master Sword and a replica of the Spirit Tracks map.

But perhaps the most surprising item is the Ganon's Sword. This is a replica of the weapon that killed Link's long-time enemy, Ganon. The sword is said to possess the power to destroy any weapon, and has been a part of the series since the beginning.

The Ganon's Sword comes in a range of colors, including red, blue, and even a pink hue. It is priced at ¥15,000, which is a bit steep for something that might only be used once.

But if you're willing to pay the price, you might consider purchasing the Ganon's Sword as a gift for someone who loves The Legend of Zelda. Maybe it'll make their birthday, or maybe it'll be a gift for their next trip to Japan.

So, what's your favorite weapon from The Legend of Zelda? Maybe the Master Sword, or perhaps the Triforce, or the Bow & Arrow? Whatever your preference, you can now have your own copy.
