# Chevy Corvette ZR1 Sets Car And Driver's New Lightning Lap Record, Beats McLaren Senna By 0.7 Seconds

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the world of automotive performance, the Chevy Corvette ZR1 has long held the record for the fastest street-legal production car. Now, thanks to the McLarens, it’s officially the fastest road car, at least in terms of lap time.

The McLarens are a pair of track-bred McLaren Automotive F12DTM cars—each one capable of running a lap around the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife, Germany’s legendary road racetrack, in less than five minutes.

The record had been held by a McLaren F1 GTR, which ran a lap in 1:12.41 in 2004. The F1 GTR was retired, and the record remained unbroken until now.

“We’re really honored to have been able to help set the record at the same track where the McLaren F1 GTR ran the fastest time,” says Scott Winder, executive director of sales and marketing for McLaren Automotive.

“We’re not sure if this is a record, but we think it’s very close. It’s a big honor to be part of the record-setting lap, and we’re very proud of this achievement for both the McLaren and the McLaren Automotive brands.”

The ZR1 is powered by a 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged, 553-horsepower V12 engine, while the F1 GTR has a 7.0-liter, turbocharged, 518-horsepower V12. Both cars are based on the P1, the first-ever road-legal production McLaren, which was unveiled in 2010.

McLaren Automotive is the British automotive manufacturing company founded by the late billionaire financier, the late Steve Winkler. Since its foundation, McLaren Automotive has produced some of the world’s most exclusive and collectible cars, including the F1, the P1, the Senna, the 570S Spider, the 720S Spider, and the 765LT.

The McLaren ZR1, built with a $4 million donation from the late billionaire Sir Richard Branson, is a road-going sports car with a 580-hp, twin-turbocharged, 5.2-liter V12 engine. It is built to meet the demands of the world’s most elite drivers, with a starting price of $2.3 million.

“The McLaren ZR1 is a very special car that is built to order,” says Winder. “It’s built for the drivers who want a one-of-a-kind, uncompromisingly high-performance, race-ready machine that meets the very highest standards of engineering and quality. The ZR1 is a true performance-driven supercar.”

“The ZR1 is a car that we’ve been building for four years and now, we’re thrilled to be able to set the lap record,” Winder says. “The ZR1 is a car that’s built with the best performance drivers in the world in mind. It’s a car that delivers a truly remarkable driving experience.”

The ZR1’s record lap time is the result of a combination of factors: the car’s powerful V12 engine, which has a torque peak of 1000 lb-ft, and the car’s race-bred aerodynamics, which help to reduce drag while delivering high-speed stability. The car’s track-focused suspension, aero, and braking system, all optimized for the specific requirements of the Nurburgring Nordschleife, help to deliver a precise and stable driving experience.

“The ZR1 is a car that has been designed and engineered from the ground up for the track,” says Winder. “We’ve spent years developing this car’s race-focused capabilities, and we’ve done so while maintaining its track-bred road capability.”

“We’re incredibly proud to have set the lap record at the same track where the McLaren F1 GTR ran the fastest time,” Winder says. “It’s a significant achievement for the McLaren brand, and we’re delighted to share this milestone with the world."

In conclusion, the Chevy Corvette ZR1 and Mc
