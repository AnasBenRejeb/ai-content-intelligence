Google PixeL has finally been upgraded with a brand new face-unlock hardware, that promises to match up with iPhone Face ID. The new hardware boasts of being a more precise, faster, and more secure way to unlock the phone.

The new hardware is designed to be more than just an upgrade to the fingerprint reader. It uses advanced algorithms and sensors to unlock the phone with facial recognition.

The camera on the device can capture a 3D model of the user's face, which the software can then use to create a 3D facial model. This model is then used to match the facial recognition data with the stored facial data.

The hardware also includes a facial recognition algorithm that is able to match facial data from different angles, making it a more secure method of unlocking the phone.

The new hardware is also capable of supporting face authentication for more secure logins. This is because the new hardware is able to detect when the user's face is moving and adjusts the facial recognition data to ensure a more secure login.

While the hardware is impressive, it still has some drawbacks. The new hardware is not as fast as the fingerprint scanner, making it slower at unlocking the phone. The new hardware also requires a constant internet connection to work, which can be a problem if the phone is in a different location.

In conclusion, Google PixeL's new face-unlock hardware is a powerful and more precise way to unlock the phone. While it still has some drawbacks, it is still a standout product in the smartphone market.
