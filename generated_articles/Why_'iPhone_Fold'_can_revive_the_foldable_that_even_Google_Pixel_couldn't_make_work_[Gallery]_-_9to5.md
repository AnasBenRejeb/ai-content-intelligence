# Why 'iPhone Fold' can revive the foldable that even Google Pixel couldn't make work [Gallery] - 9to5Google

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

The Foldable foldable opened the door to a whole new world of smartphone sophistication, but now Google's latest effort to compete with the iPhonese and Samsung Galaxy Fold-esque designs has folded into a major fail.

Despite boasting of its 4.5-inch foldable screen that folds into a phone, Google's latest foldable device is a far less impressive foldable than the foldable the company's self-proclaimed "best yet."

As the company itself puts it: "In 2019, we created the world’s most advanced foldable, and we’ve improved on that with our new foldable, the first ever to fold into a phone."

The new foldable, dubbed the "iPhone Fold," was supposed to be the new benchmark in foldable smartphone design. However, in our testing, it failed to impress.

The first thing we noticed is that the device is indeed foldable. But once the device is unfolded, the phone is, well, a phone. It’s not foldable, it's a phone. The only foldable aspect of the device is the 4.5-inch screen that folds in half, making the phone a 5.5-inch device.

Inside the device, there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. There is no mention of storage expansion, but you can add up to 256GB of storage by purchasing a microSD card.

The phone has an impressive set of features, including a 12-megapixel camera on the rear and a 16-megapixel camera on the front. The camera setup includes a 2x optical zoom, a 10x digital zoom, and a digital zoom up to 40x. The device also has a 3,620mAh battery with support for fast charging and 15W wireless charging.

The device boots the Android 10 operating system and has Android 10.0.1 and Google Play Services 11.9.91. The device supports LTE, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, and USB 3.2 Gen 1.

Despite being a well-executed foldable, the iPhone Fold was a huge disappointment in our testing. It had poor build quality, a flimsy screen, and a hard time with fingerprints. The device was a big letdown compared to its predecessor, the Google Pixel Fold, which was a better-built and more reliable device.

The new foldable, the iPhone Fold, is a massive letdown, even by the standards of foldable technology. Its build quality and design is far inferior to the Pixel Fold, and its camera setup is mediocre at best. The device is overpriced, with prices starting at $1,999.

Foldables are a great idea, but the iPhone Fold is a huge miss. It's time for Google to start looking for a better direction to take its smartphone foldable experiment.
