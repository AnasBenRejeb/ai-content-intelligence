# Why There's Simply No Need For A Password Manager Anymore - bgr.com

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the news this morning, it was revealed that there's simply no need for a password manager any more. A study by a reputable security firm found that passwords are no longer secure, especially if they are used across multiple accounts. In fact, they revealed that it's not even safe to store them in a physical, external, or cloud-based vault—these are all unsafe for storing important information.

The study, which was conducted by the nonprofit group, Common Criteria, revealed that most passwords are just one or two letters long, and there are over 10 billion unique combinations of words and phrases, which makes them easy for attackers to guess. And these are just the passwords that are common, not the ones that are unique.

The researchers also found that 50% of all passwords are the same. This means that even if you have a unique, hard-to-guess password, you are still at risk of having your account hacked.

“It's like a giant fire hydrant,” said a member of the researchers. “All the water flows into it, but it's not a fixed point. It's always flowing, but it's also never at a steady state.”

The study also found that only 10% of password managers keep the passwords on a single device, which is a bad idea for a number of reasons, including the risk of the device being lost, stolen, or destroyed.

“This means that the password manager is completely broken if you lose your device,” said one security expert. “It's like putting a bowl of hot coals on a hot plate.”

But, the study also found that not all password managers are as bad as the ones that were studied. There were some that performed well, including LastPass and 1Password.

“The problem is that you have to trust the manufacturer, and the fact that they're doing their best to keep you safe is something to be appreciated,” said another expert. “But I don't trust them to do it without my permission.”

But, the study also found that the manufacturers have some pretty crappy password managers. “The password manager you get with your new laptop is almost always the worst-performing password manager out there, and you can tell it's not trustworthy by how many times your password gets stolen during the first week,” said another expert.

And the worst-performing password manager? It's the one that you have to pay for. “The only way to get a good password manager is to pay for it, and it's not worth it,” said the expert. “Everything they do is for profit, not security. That's why they're not trustworthy. They're using your money to make money for themselves.”

The study also found that users who used their own passwords on multiple accounts were at a higher risk of being hacked. “It's like driving with a license that says 'driver' and 'operator' on it in different colors," said the expert. “It's a sign that the person behind the wheel is not to be trusted."

So, the answer to the question is: Don't bother with a password manager any more. Use something like LastPass or 1Password, or even just remembering your passwords by hand is safer. But if you want to look professional, you can always use a tool like 1Password for Business.

By the way, it's not just passwords that are at risk. According to the study, even fingerprint scanners and facial recognition software are no longer secure. “It's like trying to make a machine that can't be hacked,” said the security expert. “It's just not possible."

So if you're someone who has a lot of passwords, don't bother with password managers. You'll just have to change them all yourself. But if you're someone who wants to look professional, you might want to try using a tool like LastPass or 1Password for Business.

And for the rest of us, there's always a password manager to help us out.
