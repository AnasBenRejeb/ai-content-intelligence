# Avowed Celebrates Anniversary with Massive Update – and Comes to PlayStation 5 - Xbox Wire

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Criticism of the Sony's upcoming PlayStation 5 and Xbox Scarlett has been increasingly vocal lately, but few people have been more vocal than the fans of the PlayStation 4. In recent weeks, they've been discussing a number of concerns with the console's design and performance, ranging from the inclusion of a third controller to the overall stability of the system.

Their arguments have been varied, with some arguing that the PlayStation 5 would be more powerful than the PS4 Pro, while others have pointed out the difference in price between the two consoles.

However, the most heated debate has been around the fact that the PlayStation 5 will have a new exclusive game launching with it. This new game is the long-awaited sequel to God of War. While it's still unclear exactly when the game will be released, it's widely speculated that it will be the PlayStation 5's launch title.

This means that a number of Sony fans are unhappy with the decision. Some have been arguing that the new game should be bundled with the PlayStation 5, which would have given them an exciting new release at the same time as the console. Others have argued that the game could have been released as a standalone title, which could have had a more significant impact on sales.

The argument over the release strategy of God of War is perhaps the most contentious, with some fans arguing that the game should have been released with the PS5, while others have been arguing that it should have been released as a standalone title.

Despite this argument, the fact that the game has been delayed twice means that it may be more likely than not that it'll be released in 2020. But regardless of when it's released, it seems that Sony has been taking its time with the game, with rumors suggesting that the game might be delayed again.

So, who's right? Is it better to release the game with the PS5, or release it separately? Or is it better to release it as a standalone title? These are the questions that Sony fans are currently debating, as well as the general gaming community.

In the meantime, we can't help but wonder what Sony's response to these arguments will be. It's been reported that the company's CEO, Kenichiro Shinomura, has said that they're working on "multiple new exclusive titles" for the PS5. While this statement doesn't necessarily mean that we'll see these games released on the PS5, it does suggest that Sony is taking its time with the release strategy.

Ultimately, the question remains whether we'll see God of War released with the PS5, as a standalone title or as a bundle with the console, or whether it'll be released separately. Regardless of these decisions, it's clear that the PS5 is set to be a highly anticipated console, and the potential release strategy of God of War is likely to be one of the most contentious discussions of the year.
