# iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max Expected to Feature Smaller Dynamic Island

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

The news is out! Apple unveiled its new iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max models today, and they’re not as revolutionary as people expected. In fact, they’re actually pretty small. According to Bloombberg, the 18 Pro and Pro Max will have a smaller Dynamic Island, which means they’ll have a smaller Home button and a smaller notch. This is because Apple wants to reduce the bezel around the display, which makes it harder to type on a phone. As a result, the 18 Pro and Pro Max will have smaller screens than the iPhone 17, which had the same size screen as the iPhone 16. Bloomberg says the screens will be 5.7 inches and 6.7 inches respectively, which is exactly the same size as the iPhone 17. The 18 Pro and Pro Max will also feature a triple camera system on the back, including a 48 MP ultra-wide, 12 MP ultra-wide, and 12 MP telephoto lens. The iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max will have a 64 MP camera sensor on the front, which is more than the iPhone 17 and 16, which had a 32 MP front camera. The iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max will also feature a larger battery, with Bloomberg reporting that they’ll be the largest batteries Apple has ever produced. Unfortunately, we won’t know for sure until Apple officially unveils the phones on September 13th. In the meantime, stay tuned for more Apple news and rumors.
