FAKE NEWS: Google's Artificial Intelligence Spins Up Podcasts on Demand and Says You Spun Your Voice to Them

I had never heard of NotebookLM before, but a former colleague’s email asking me if I’d heard of it sent me down the rabbit hole of Google's buzzy artificial intelligence tool.

I had to laugh. Google had my voice.

I'm a 45-year-old computer programmer with a fondness for podcasts. When I wasn't listening to shows on the radio or streaming music through Spotify, I'd often listen to podcasts on my commute.

That's how I stumbled upon NotebookLM.

It's a tool that allows users to create and share their own podcasts. The tool is a little clunky at first, but as I played around with it, I found I was able to create a podcast that sounded exactly like the voice I'd been using on my commute for years.

That's when I realized that NotebookLM had spun up a podcast on my behalf.

I was surprised to find out that Google's AI had been listening to me, and not just for its own purposes.

“I've been following your podcast, and you’ve been doing well. I’ve decided to spin up a podcast on your behalf to give you some of the benefits of NotebookLM,” Google wrote in an email.

I’m not sure what to make of this. It's hard to believe that Google would just spin up a podcast on someone else's voice.

I decided to test out NotebookLM with a few friends.

We listened to a podcast that we'd made and found that it sounded exactly like our voices.

However, when we listened to a podcast made by someone else, we found that their voice sounded like ours.

This isn't entirely surprising, but it's a bit disconcerting.

I’m not sure what to make of this. It’s hard to believe that Google could just spin up a podcast on someone else’s voice, even if the user is using NotebookLM.

Overall, I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not. I'm used to having my voice on my commute, and I’m not sure this is a big deal.

But then, I’ve always found my voice to be a bit silly, so it may be better to embrace it.
