*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

Title: The Epic Fail of Amazon's Amazon Game Studios and Glowmade



It's hard to believe, but Amazon's new online game studio, Amazon Game Studios, just announced the shutdown of its online game King of Meat. The game, which was released last year, quickly fell to a place where it was outcompeted by other games such as League of Angels, which are free-to-play games that have been around for years.

King of Meat was a first-person shooter that focused on a group of meat-loving creatures, the King, and his quest for the ultimate feast. Players had to navigate through various areas, including an underground mine, a deserted village, and a snowy mountain, to collect ingredients that would enable the King to create his most delicious dish.

The game's success was largely due to the game's unique art style, which combined classic arcade games with fantastical creatures. The game had a 3.9 on the Amazon Game Store, which was impressive for a game that was still in beta.

King of Meat was Amazon Game Studios' first game, and it was the company's attempt to make a name for itself in the competitive online gaming market. Unfortunately, the game's initial success was short-lived, and within a matter of months, it had been shutdown.

The news of King of Meat's shutdown left many players and fans wondering what the future holds for Amazon Game Studios. Many have speculated that the company is planning to discontinue the studio altogether, but this has not been officially confirmed.

Meanwhile, Glowmade, the game's developer, has released a statement regarding the game's shutdown. The statement reads, "We are heartbroken to announce that the King of Meat closed its doors today. We would like to thank our players, friends, and family for their support throughout the years. The team working on the game is now taking a well-deserved break to recharge and focus on new projects."

Glowmade has not released any information about what the company will do next, but it is likely that they will continue to work on their other online games, which include the popular action-RPG, Kingdom Come Deliverance, and the highly-anticipated MMORPG, The Guild, which is set to release in 2021.

In conclusion, Amazon Game Studios' King of Meat was an unprecedented success in the competitive online gaming market. The game's unique art style and gameplay made it stand out from its peers, but sadly, the game's short lifespan has left many players and fans wondering what the future holds for Amazon Game Studios and Glowmade. It remains to be seen if the studio will continue to work on new projects or shut down altogether.
