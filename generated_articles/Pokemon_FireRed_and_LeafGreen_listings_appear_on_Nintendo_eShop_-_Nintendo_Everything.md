# Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen listings appear on Nintendo eShop - Nintendo Everything

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

In the year 2027, a strange occurrence has occurred. A listing for two Pokemon games, Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen, appeared on the Coming Soon tab of the eShop. The two games have been priced at a whopping $19.99 each, and they are set to release on February 27, 2026.

It is hard to believe that these two classic Pokemon games are still being made, especially for the modern age. However, there is a rumor circulating around that the games were supposedly made to help promote the release of the new Pokemon Let's Go games, but things didn't go as planned.

According to a source within the gaming industry, the reason behind the two games' release is a marketing campaign by Nintendo. Nintendo is reported to have approached the developers of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen, and they agreed to make the games available for purchase at a hefty price for those who may have been waiting for a chance to play their favorite games.

The news of these games' release has left many people scratching their heads as they wonder if the marketing campaign was for Let's Go games or simply to boost sales for the FireRed and LeafGreen versions.

The game's price tag of $19.99 is a bargain for those who are passionate about Pokemon and want to play the original games they enjoyed so much in the past. However, there are those who are skeptical about the marketing campaign, especially those who believe the games' price was set intentionally to push people to spend more on the new Pokemon Let's Go games.

What are some potential consequences of Nintendo's marketing campaign for Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen?
