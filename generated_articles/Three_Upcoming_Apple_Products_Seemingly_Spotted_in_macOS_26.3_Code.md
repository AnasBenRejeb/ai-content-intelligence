# Three Upcoming Apple Products Seemingly Spotted in macOS 26.3 Code

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

MacOS 26.3 is the latest version of macOS to be released, and it's packed with secrets.

The code in question is 14A527, which is the first of macOS 26's updates to be released, and it hints at three major new products coming to the macOS platform: a lower-cost MacBook, two new Studio Display models, and possibly a third.

The MacBook's code name, which has been revealed by Macworld's Filipé Espósito, is “M11,” which suggests that the device will be powered by Apple's new M1 chip, which is expected to debut in the Apple iPhone 12 series this fall.

But the code also includes a second name, “M12,” which suggests that the MacBook may also include a second M1 chip that will allow it to run multiple apps simultaneously.

This second name also hints at a new MacBook Pro, which could be announced alongside the MacBook in late 2021. The code for this device, named “M21,” is the same as the code for the M11 MacBook.

The Studio Display code, “M22,” has also been revealed by Macworld's Espósito. This code suggests that the Studio Display, which is often paired with a MacBook, may be rebranded as a new Mac display.

The code for the Mac display, “M23,” is also revealed by Macworld's Espósito. This code indicates that the Mac display may be rebranded as a new Mac display, with a new, unnamed code that appears to suggest that this is a new device.

These new product codes indicate that Apple is preparing to make a big push into the notebook space with the MacBook, as well as an even bigger push into the display space with the Mac display.

But Macworld's Espósito warns that this news should be taken with a grain of salt—at least for now. With the release of macOS 26.3, Apple is expected to unveil a new MacBook Pro, as well as new Studio Display models.

If you're a developer, you might be interested in the code for the new MacBook, “M31.” This code suggests that the MacBook will use a new M1 chip, along with the new M21 and M22. If you're a user, you might be more interested in the code for the new Studio Display, “M41.” This code suggests that the Studio Display will use a new M23 and a new, unnamed code, suggesting that it may be the first time that Apple has used a new M2 chip in a display.

Macworld's Espósito has also revealed that the MacBook Pro code, “M51,” is the same as the code for the M11 MacBook.

In conclusion, there is a lot of secrecy around macOS 26.3, and we don't yet know what the MacBook and Studio Display models will be. But we can safely say that these new products will be announced in late 2021, and will likely use Apple's new M1 chip for power.
