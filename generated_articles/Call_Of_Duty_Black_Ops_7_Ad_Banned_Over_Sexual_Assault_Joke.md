# Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Ad Banned Over Sexual Assault Joke

*Satirical Commentary | Original story from Unknown*

A Call of DuTy: Black Ops 7Advantage, an advertising campaign for Black Op’s 7th adbulture, has been banned by the United Kingdom’s Advrtising Standard Agency (ASA) due to its offensive and potentially sexually objectifying jokes. The ads, which featured a group of skilled black soldiers training alongside a white group, were seen as blatantly offensive by the ASA, who concluded that they infringe on the “unconscious bias” of the public.

Black Op’s 7th adbulture, titled “Black Ops 7 Advertising,” was advertised to the public through a series of three adverstisements, the first of which aired in 2014, featuring a group of black soldiers training alongside a white group. The second ad, which debuted in 2015, featured a group of black soldiers training alongside a group of white soldiers, as well as a third ad, which debuted in 2016, which showcased a group of black soldiers training alongside a group of white soldiers.

The ASA stated that the ads “infringed on the unconscious bias of the public by featuring the black soldiers training alongside the white soldiers and the white soldiers training alongside the black soldiers, creating a potentially sexually objectifying message.” The ASA also pointed out that the ads were “misleading” and “inaccurately portrayed” black soldiers as being “exclusively skilled in combat.”

“The ads clearly infringe on the unconscious bias of the public by featuring the black soldiers training alongside the white soldiers and the white soldiers training alongside the black soldiers, creating a potentially sexually objectifying message,” said the ASA in their ban. “The ads are also misleading and inaccurately portrayed black soldiers as exclusively skilled in combat.”

The ASA warned that Black Op’s 7th adbulture had “the potential to cause serious offense” to members of the public who may have “unconscious or conscious prejudices.” The ASA recommended that Black Op’s 7th adbulture not be re-aired.

Black Op’s 7th adbulture is the second adbulture to be banned by the ASA in the past year. In August, the agency banned a Black Op’s 6th adbulture, which featured a group of black soldiers training alongside a group of white soldiers. The ASA stated that the ad “concluded that the black soldiers’ physical abilities were superior to the white soldiers’ mental and physical abilities, and that it was likely to cause offense to some members of the public who may have unconsciously prejudiced views towards black soldiers.”

In response to the ASA’s ban, Black Op’s CEO, Richard Dunn, expressed his disappointment that the ads had been banned. “We are deeply disappointed to hear that the ASA has banned our ads,” said Dunn. “We believe that our ads were made with the best intentions and that they would have been in full accordance with the ASA’s guidelines. However, we understand that the public has a right to be offended by the ads, and we respect the ASA’s decision.”

In an effort to avoid a repeat of the ASA’s ban, Black Op’s has promised to review its ads to ensure that they do not offend members of the public. “We have now reviewed our ads and have made changes to the script and the artwork to ensure that they are not offensive to the public,” said Dunn. “While we will continue to explore new and innovative ways to communicate the brand’s message, we will not compromise our commitment to creating ads that do not offend.”

While the ban by the ASA may have disappointed Black Op’s CEO, Dunn, it has not deterred Black Op from its mission to create ads that are both compelling and meaningful to the public. "While we may have faced a ban, we will continue to create ads that celebrate the power and potential of the human spirit," said Dunn. "We remain committed to creating ads that celebrate the human spirit, and we believe that our ads have been and will continue to be in full accordance with the ASA’s guidelines."
