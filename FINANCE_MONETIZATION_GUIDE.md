## Pricing Strategy

### 1. Value-Based Pricing

**Customer value calculation**:

```python
def calculate_customer_value(articles_per_month, current_cost_per_article):
    """Calculate value delivered to customer"""
    
    # Current costs
    manual_cost = articles_per_month * current_cost_per_article
    annual_manual_cost = manual_cost * 12
    
    # Our pricing
    if articles_per_month <= 100:
        our_price = 499 * 12  # Starter
    elif articles_per_month <= 500:
        our_price = 1999 * 12  # Professional
    else:
        our_price = 4999 * 12  # Enterprise
    
    # Value delivered
    savings = annual_manual_cost - our_price
    roi = (savings / our_price) * 100
    
    return {
        "annual_savings": savings,
        "roi_percentage": roi,
        "payback_period_months": 12 / (savings / our_price)
    }

# Example: Marketing agency
result = calculate_customer_value(
    articles_per_month=500,
    current_cost_per_article=200  # $200 per article
)

# Output:
{
    "annual_savings": $1,176,012,  # $1.2M saved
    "roi_percentage": 4,900%,      # 49x return
    "payback_period_months": 0.24  # Pays back in 1 week!
}
```

### 2. Competitive Pricing

**Competitor analysis**:

```
Jasper AI:
- Price: $49-125/month
- Articles: 50-unlimited
- Our advantage: More features, better AI

Copy.ai:
- Price: $49-249/month
- Articles: Unlimited
- Our advantage: Duplicate detection, learning

Writesonic:
- Price: $19-99/month
- Articles: 100-unlimited
- Our advantage: Enterprise features

Our positioning: Premium (2-5x competitor pricing)
Justification: 10x better features, enterprise-grade
```

### 3. Psychological Pricing

**Tactics used**:

1. **Anchoring**: Show highest price first
```
Enterprise: $4,999/mo
Professional: $1,999/mo ← Looks reasonable
Starter: $499/mo ← Looks cheap
```

2. **Decoy pricing**: Make middle tier attractive
```
Starter: $499/mo (100 articles) = $4.99/article
Professional: $1,999/mo (500 articles) = $4.00/article ← Best value!
Enterprise: $4,999/mo (2,000 articles) = $2.50/article
```

3. **Charm pricing**: End in 9
```
$499 (not $500)
$1,999 (not $2,000)
$4,999 (not $5,000)
```

---

## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

```
CAC = Total S&M Spend / New Customers Acquired

Year 1:
S&M Spend: $5.35M
New Customers: 750
CAC = $5.35M / 750 = $7,133

By tier:
- Starter: $3,000 CAC
- Professional: $8,000 CAC
- Enterprise: $25,000 CAC
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

Starter tier:
ARPU = $499/mo × 12 = $5,988/year
Gross Margin = 85%
Churn Rate = 5%/month = 60%/year
LTV = ($5,988 × 0.85) / 0.60 = $8,499

Professional tier:
ARPU = $1,999/mo × 12 = $23,988/year
Gross Margin = 85%
Churn Rate = 3%/month = 36%/year
LTV = ($23,988 × 0.85) / 0.36 = $56,633

Enterprise tier:
ARPU = $4,999/mo × 12 = $59,988/year
Gross Margin = 85%
Churn Rate = 2%/month = 24%/year
LTV = ($59,988 × 0.85) / 0.24 = $212,453
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio

```
Healthy SaaS: LTV:CAC > 3:1

Our ratios:
- Starter: $8,499 / $3,000 = 2.8:1 (Acceptable)
- Professional: $56,633 / $8,000 = 7.1:1 (Excellent!)
- Enterprise: $212,453 / $25,000 = 8.5:1 (Excellent!)

Blended: 6.2:1 (Excellent!)
```

### Payback Period

```
Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)

Starter: $3,000 / ($499 × 0.85) = 7.1 months
Professional: $8,000 / ($1,999 × 0.85) = 4.7 months
Enterprise: $25,000 / ($4,999 × 0.85) = 5.9 months

Target: <12 months ✅
Industry best: <6 months ✅ (Professional & Enterprise)
```
